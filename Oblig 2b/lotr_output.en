The world is changing .
I can feel it in the water .
I can feel it in the earth .
I smell it in the air .
Much , what once was , is lost , since no one lives anymore , which remembers .
It began with the forging of the Great Rings .
3 were given to the Elves , to the immortal , wisest and purest of all beings .
7 to the dwarf rulers , great miners and craftsmen in their halls of stone .
And 9 ... 9 rings were given to the people who strive above all others for power .
For these rings bare the strength and the will to guide every people .
But they were all deceived .
Because another ring was made .
In the land of Mordor , in the fire of the Fate Hill , the Dark Ruler Sauron secretly forged a master ring to dominate all others .
In this ring flowed his cruelty , his wickedness and his will to suppress all life .
A ring to enslave them .
In turn , the free countries of Middle-earth came under the rule of the Ring .
But some resisted .
A final alliance of people and elves moved into the battle against Mordor .
On the slopes of the Destiny Hill they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth .
The victory was close .
But the power of the ring was not to break .
Then it happened , when all hope vanished , that Isildur , the king's son , took the sword of his father .
Sauron , the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth , was defeated .
The ring went to Isildur , who now had the opportunity to destroy the evil forever .
But people's hearts are easy to seduce .
And the ring of power has its own will .
He betrayed Isildur and brought him death .
And what should not have been forgotten , was lost .
History became legend . Legend became myth .
And for 2500 years the ring was forgotten .
Until one day he was looking for a new carrier .
My darling .
The ring fell into the hands of the creature Gollum , carried into the foggy mountains .
And there he fell into the ring .
He came to me .
My own .
My love .
My own .
My darling .
The ring gave Gollum an unnaturally long life .
For 500 years he poisoned his mind .
And in the darkness of Gollum's cave he waited .
Darkness lay over the forest of the world .
Rumors were loud about a shadow in the east . A nameless horror went around .
And the ring felt that his time had come .
He left Gollum .
But there was something that the ring had not intended .
He was found by the most unlikely creature .
What's that?
A Hobbit .
Bilbo Beutlin from the Auenland .
A ring .
Disappeared!
My treasure has disappeared!
Because soon comes the time , as the Hobbits will determine the fate of all .
The Auenland 60 years later
The road glides away and away , away from the door , where it began , far across land from place to place , I follow it , as well as I can .
You're late .
A wizard never comes too late , Frodo Beutlin .
Or too soon .
It appears exactly as intended .
What a pleasure to see you , Gandalf!
How could I forget Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
What's going on outside in the world?
Tell me everything .
Everything?
For a Hobbit you are too curious .
Very unusual .
What do you want me to tell you?
Life in the wide world is the same as in the past .
A constant coming and going .
Hardly anyone is aware of the existence of the Hobbits .
For which I am very grateful .
The long-awaited feast .
How's the old man doing?
As I heard , it should be a particularly magnificent celebration .
You know Bilbo .
Here are all from the house .
Exactly to his liking .
Half of Auenland is invited .
You're a little bit sweet!
- He's up to something .
- In fact . All right .
Just keep it to yourself .
Before you showed up , we were Beutlin's respected people .
We were never entangled in adventure .
If you mean the incident with the dragon , I was hardly involved in it .
I just pushed your uncle out the door .
Whatever you have done , you are now officially considered a troublemaker .
Oh , really?
Fireworks , Gandalf!
- I'm glad you're back .
- Me too , my dear boy .
Me too .
No , thank you!
No more visitors , congratulations or distant relatives!
And what about very old friends?
Bilbo Beutlin .
My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you . 111 years old .
Is that to be believed?
You haven't aged a bit .
Come in!
Welcome , welcome .
Tea? Maybe something stronger after all .
I still have a few bottles of Age Wingert . 1296 .
Very good vintage .
Almost as old as I am .
My father still pressed it .
What do you mean , let's open one?
Just tea , thank you .
I was expecting you last week .
But you come and go as you like .
Always . I'm a little unprepared .
I only have cold chicken and pickles .
There's some cheese .
No , it's not good anymore .
We have raspberry jam , an apple pie .
But not much for dessert .
Oh , no , we're saved!
There's another biscuit cake .
I could fry eggs .
Just tea , thank you .
Oh , of course .
Bad when I eat?
Not at all .
I'm not home!
I have to get away from this fucking kinship , never leaves you alone .
I want to see mountains again .
Mountains , Gandalf!
A quiet place where I can finish my book .
Oh , the tea .
Then you want to carry out your plan?
Yes .
Everything is ready .
All precautions have been taken .
Frodo has suspected .
Of course he did .
He is a beutlin , not a simple belt of rock .
You're telling him , aren't you?
He likes you very much .
I know .
He'd probably come with , I'd ask him .
I think deep inside Frodo still hangs on the Auenland .
At the woods , the fields .
The small rivers .
I'm old , Gandalf .
It doesn't look at me , but I feel it deep in my heart .
I feel thin .
Somehow emaciated , how butter spread on too much bread .
I need a vacation .
Very long vacation .
And I probably won't return .
Honestly , I don't intend to .
Old Tobi .
The best herb in the whole southern district .
Gandalf , my old friend , this evening we will remember many times .
Good to see you .
Come on , Sam .
Request Rosie to dance on .
I'd rather have some beer .
Oh , no .
Go on .
There I stood , at the mercy of the three terrifying trolls .
They argued about how they should probably cook us , whether grill on the skewer or whether they should sit on us and crush us .
They fought over the pros and cons until the first sunlight crawled over the treetops and they all turned to stone .
Quickly .
No , the big one .
- She's got to be in the ground .
- She's in the ground .
That was your idea .
- Watch out , the dragon!
- Dragon? Nonsense . There have been no dragons here for 1000 years .
That was good .
Let's get another one!
Meriadoc Brandybock and Peregrin Tuk .
I thought so .
A speech , Bilbo!
A speech!
My dear Beutlins and Boffins , Tuks and Brandybocks , Grubers , Pausbackens ,
Tight belt and pride foot .
Today is my 111th birthday!
But unfortunately , ninety-one years are far too short to live under such fine hobbits .
I don't know half of you half as well as I want , and like less than half of you only half as much as you deserve .
I've got things to do .
I've delayed it far too long .
I regret to announce that this is the end!
I'm going now .
I say goodbye to you very warmly .
Farewell .
You must have thought that was very clever .
Come on , Gandalf .
Have you seen their faces?
There are many magic rings in the world , and none should be used recklessly .
It was just a little fun .
I guess you're right again , as always .
You'll have an eye on Frodo , will you?
2 eyes .
As often as I can spare them .
I leave everything to him .
What about your ring?
Is he staying here too?
Yes , yes .
He's in an envelope on the mantel .
No . No .
Isn't that weird?
Why not?
Why shouldn't I keep it?
You should leave the ring behind , Bilbo .
Is that so hard?
Well , no .
And yes .
Now that it's time , I don't want to give it up .
I found him!
No need to get angry .
It's your fault!
He's mine .
My own .
My darling .
Honey?
That's what he was called before , but not by you .
What do you care what I do with my stuff?
You've had the ring long enough .
You want him yourself!
Don't think I'm a magician of lazy tricks .
I don't want to rob you .
I want to help you .
All these years we were friends .
Trust me , just like before .
Give it up .
You're right , Gandalf .
The ring must go to Frodo .
It's late .
The path is long .
Yes , it's time .
You still have the ring in your pocket .
Here's the end for my book:
And he lived happily afterwards until the end of his days .
I'm sure you will , my dear friend .
Goodbye , Gandalf .
Goodbye , dear Bilbo .
Until our next meeting .
It's mine .
My own .
My darling .
Mysteries in the Darkness .
My darling .
Honey .
He's gone , isn't he?
He talked about it for so long . I thought it was a joke .
Bilbo's ring .
He opened up to the elves and left you a bag end .
With all his possessions .
The ring is now yours .
Hide him well .
Where are you going?
I care about things .
What things?
Questions . That require an answer .
You just came .
I don't understand .
Me neither .
Keep him secret .
Keep him well .
Auenland!
Beutlin!
The year 3434 of the 2nd Age .
These are the records of Isildur , the High King of Gondor , of the discovery of the Ring of Power .
He came to me .
The one ring .
He is an heirloom of my kingdom .
My descendants should be bound to his fate , because I do not dare that something happens to the ring .
He is my treasure , even if I buy him with great pain .
The lines on the ring begin to fade .
The font , first as clear as a red flame , has already disappeared .
A secret that only fire can reveal .
Auenland .
Beutlin .
There are no beutlins here .
They're all in Hobbingen .
Over there .
Doesn't anyone know about it?
Is he well hidden?
What are you doing?
Hold your hand .
He's all cool .
What do you see?
Do you see anything?
Nothing .
There's nothing there .
Wait .
There are lines .
Some kind of Elbish .
I can't read it .
Only a few can .
It's the language of Mordor I don't want to speak here .
In our language it means:
A ring to enslave them , to find them all , to drive into the dark . And to bind forever .
This is the One Ring , forged by the Dark Ruler Sauron in the Fire of the Fate Hill .
Isildur cut him from Sauron's hand and took him for himself .
Bilbo found him .
In Gollum's cave .
For 60 years , the ring was in Bilbo's custody , extended his life , did not let him age .
But that's over .
The evil moves into Mordor .
The ring has awakened .
He's heard his master's reputation .
But he was destroyed .
Sauron was destroyed .
No , Frodo .
The spirit of Sauron continued to live .
His life force is tied to the ring , and the ring remained .
Sauron has returned .
His orcs have become more numerous .
Its fortress Barad-dúr is rebuilt in Mordor .
Sauron only needs this ring to cover all countries in darkness .
He's looking for him .
Find him .
All his thoughts apply to him .
And the ring wants nothing more arduous than to return to the hand of its master .
They are one , the ring and the Dark Ruler .
He must never find him .
All right .
We'll put him away .
We hide him and never mention him again .
No one knows where he is , right?
Or , Gandalf?
Someone knew that Bilbo had the ring .
I searched everywhere for the creature Gollum .
But the enemy first discovered him .
I don't know how long they tortured him .
But under endless screams and stutters they recognized 2 words :
Auenland .
Beutlin .
That'll bring them here!
Who's there?
Take it , Gandalf!
- Take it!
- No , you have to take it .
Don't trust me!
I'll give it to you!
Don't try me , Frodo!
I don't dare to take it .
Not even to keep him .
You see , Frodo . I would want to do good with this ring .
But through me he would possess too great and appalling power .
But he can't stay here!
He can't .
What do I have to do?
You have to go .
Quickly .
Where?
Leave the Auenland .
Go to Bree .
And what about you?
I'm waiting for you at the inn to dance pony .
Is the ring safe?
I don't know , Frodo .
I can't say .
I must meet the Supreme of my Order .
He is wise and powerful . Trust me , Frodo .
He knows advice .
You'll have to take the name Beutlin .
He's too dangerous outside the Auenland .
Travel only in the day .
And off the road .
I'm just going cross-country .
My dear Frodo .
Hobbits are really amazing creatures .
In a month you can learn everything about them .
And 100 years later you can still surprise one .
Duck yourself .
By my beard , Samweis Gamjie!
Have you obeyed?
I never obey .
I just cut the weed .
A little late to cut grass!
I heard voices .
What did you hear?
Don't say anything important .
I heard of a ring , a dark ruler and
Please , Lord , don't hurt me .
Don't turn me into a monster .
No?
Maybe not .
I thought of something better .
Come on , Samweis .
Do not dawdle .
Be careful , both of you .
The enemy has many scouts :
Birds , animals .
Is he sure?
Never use him , for his power attracts the servants of the Dark Ruler .
Always remember , the ring is trying to return to its master .
He wants to be found .
It's time .
What's up?
One more step , and I'm as far away from home as never before .
Come on , Sam .
Bilbo always said:
It's a dangerous thing , Frodo , to get out of your door .
You enter the road , and if you don't watch your feet , you can't know where they're carrying you .
Smoke rises above the Fate Hill .
It's high time .
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengart and asks me for advice .
Because that's why you came , isn't it?
My old friend .
Saruman .
Are you sure about that?
Without a doubt .
So the ring of power was found .
All these years he was in the Auenland .
Right in front of my nose .
And yet you did not see him .
Your preference for the herb of halflings has clouded your senses .
But it's still time enough to defeat Sauron if we act quickly .
Time?
How much time do you think we have?
Sauron has regained much of his former strength .
He cannot yet take shape , but his spirit has lost nothing of his power .
Hidden in his fortress , the Lord of Mordor sees everything .
His gaze pierces clouds , shadows , earth and flesh .
You know what I'm talking about , Gandalf?
A big eye , lidlos , bordered by flames .
Yes , Sauron .
He gathers all evil around him .
Soon his army will be strong enough to attack Middle Earth .
You know that?
How?
I've seen it .
A Palantír is a dangerous tool , Saruman .
Why should we be afraid to use it?
It is still unexplained where the other seeing stones are .
We don't know who else is watching .
Time shrinks faster than you think .
Sauron's force is already on its way .
The 9 have left Minas Morgul .
They crossed the river Isen on midsummer evening in the shape of black riders .
You're in the Auenland?
You'll find the ring .
And kill the one who carries him with him .
Frodo!
Did you really think a Hobbit would come against Sauron's will?
There is no one who can do that .
There can be no victory against the power of Mordor .
We have to ally with him , Gandalf .
We have to ally with Sauron .
It would be wise , my friend .
Tell me , friend , since when does Saruman prefer the wise to the madness of reason?
I gave you the opportunity to help me of your own free will , but you decide for the pain!
- I thought I lost you .
- What are you talking about?
Gandalf said something .
What did he say?
Don't lose him , Samweis Gamjie . I won't .
We're still in the Auenland .
What can happen to us?
Merry , this is Frodo Beutlin .
Get off him!
What are you doing here?
You stole Bauer Maggot's vegetables!
Get out of my field!
Why is he so upset?
It's just a few turnips .
And cabbages .
And the 3 sacks of potatoes last week .
And the mushrooms the week before .
Yes , Pippin .
I'm telling you , he's overreacting .
Run!
That was close .
I think I broke something .
Typical Brandybock and Tuk!
What?
That was just a shortcut .
Cross field .
Cross field where?
Mushrooms!
Let's get off the street .
Come on , get off the road!
Quick!
Quiet!
What was that?
Do you see anything?
Nothing .
What's going on?
The Black Horseman was looking for something .
Someone .
Duck!
I have to leave the Auenland .
Sam and I have to go to Bree .
I see .
Bockenburg ferry .
Follow me .
Follow me!
Get rid of the dew , Sam!
Run , Frodo!
Quick!
Where else can you get over?
Over the Brandy Wine Bridge . 20 miles .
Come on .
What do you want?
We want to get into the dancing pony .
Hobbits .
4 Hobbits .
- What brings you to Bree?
- We want to stay at the inn .
The reason is our cause .
It's all right , young gentleman .
I didn't mean bad .
After nightfall I have to ask .
Are strange people on the way .
You can't be careful enough .
Excuse me .
Good evening , my little gentlemen .
If your accommodation is looking for , there are still nice , cozy rooms in Hobbit size free .
Sir?
Unterberg .
My name is Unterberg .
Unterberg .
We want to go to Gandalf the Grey .
I know . Such an old boy .
Long , grey beard , pointed hat .
He hasn't been here in six months .
What do we do now?
He's coming .
What's that?
That , my friend , is a jug of beer .
You drink it out of jugs?
I'll get one , too .
You've had a whole half .
That guy's been staring at you since we got here .
Excuse me .
The man in the corner .
Who's that?
One of the forest runners .
Dangerous people , wandering people .
I don't know his real name , but they call him strings .
Strings .
Beutlin .
Beutlin .
Beutlin .
Of course I know a Beutlin .
That's where he's sitting .
My cousin 2nd degree , maternally , and my cousin 3rd degree ...
Watch it .
You can't hide .
I see you .
There is no life in nothingness .
Only death .
You attract too much attention , Herr Unterberg .
What do you want?
You're not carrying anything .
I'm not wearing anything . Of course .
I can avoid seeing me , but completely disappearing , is a rare gift .
Who are you?
Are you afraid?
Yes .
By far not enough .
I know who's following you .
Leave him alone , you long misery!
You've got a good heart , kid .
But it doesn't save you .
Don't wait any longer for the wizard , Frodo .
They're coming .
Who are they?
Once they were humans .
Great kings of men .
Then Sauron the traitor gave them the 9 rings of power .
Blind before greed they accepted them without asking .
And fell into the darkness .
Now they are slaves of his will .
They are the Nazgûl .
Ring spirits .
Neither alive nor dead .
At all times they feel the presence of the ring , driven by the power of the One .
They'll hunt you forever .
Where are you taking us?
Into the wilderness .
How do we know Strings is a friend of Gandalf's?
We have to trust him .
But where does he lead us?
To Bruchtal , Mr . Gamjie .
Home Elronds .
Do you hear that?
To Bruchtal .
We'll see the Elves .
We stop at nightfall .
What about breakfast? You had that .
The 1st , yes .
What about the second breakfast?
I don't think he knows anything like that , Pip .
And the 11 o'clock snack?
Lunch?
Four o'clock tea?
Dinner?
Night meal?
He knows that , doesn't he?
Don't count on it .
The power of Isengart is ready for you , Sauron , ruler of the earth .
Give me an army worthy of Mordor .
New instructions from Mordor , my master?
What does the eye command?
There's work .
The trees are strong , my master .
Their roots penetrate deeply .
Pull them all out .
This was the watchtower of Amon Sûl .
This is where we rest tonight .
These are for you .
Always carry it with you .
I'll take a look around .
Stay here .
What are you doing?
Tomatoes , sausages , crispy bacon .
There's something for you too .
Turn it off , you twats!
Ash on my tomatoes!
Up!
Back up , you devils!
Help him , strings .
A Morgulklinge hurt him .
For this my healing art is not enough .
He needs elbian medicine .
- Quick!
- It's 6 marches a day to Bruchtal!
Hold on , Frodo .
He's getting cold .
Will he die?
He glides over into the shadow world .
Soon he will be a ghost like them .
They're very close .
Do you know the athelas plant?
King's herb .
Yeah , that's a weed .
It stops the poisoning . Hurry up .
A forest runner who is not on the alert?
I'm Arwen .
I'm coming to help you .
Listen to my voice .
Come back into the light!
Who is she?
She's an elve woman .
He's fading .
He won't be doing it long .
Let's take him to my father .
I've been looking for you for two days .
5 ring spirits are behind you .
Where the other 4 are , I don't know .
Stay with the hobbits .
I'll send you horses .
I ride faster .
The road is too dangerous .
What are they talking about?
When I cross the river , the power of my people will protect him .
I'm not afraid of them .
Ride quickly . Don't look back .
What are you doing?
The ring spirits are still there!
Give us the halfling , Elbswoman!
If you want him , come and ask for him .
Frodo , no .
Frodo , don't give up .
Not now .
May the grace that I have been given pass to him .
Spare him .
Save him .
Where am I?
You're in Elrond's house .
It's 10 o'clock in the morning of October 24th , if you want to know .
Yes , I'm here .
And you're lucky you're here too .
A few more hours , and we couldn't have helped you anymore .
But you have some strength in you , my dear Hobbit .
What happened , Gandalf?
Why didn't you come?
I'm sorry , Frodo .
I was stopped .
The friendship of Saruman you do not give up lightly .
A bad turn is worth the other .
It's over .
Choose the power of the ring , or choose your own downfall .
Lord of the Ring .
He alone can make the ring bow to his will .
And he doesn't share his power .
So you choose death .
What's the matter?
Nothing , Frodo .
How beautiful , you're awake .
Sam barely left your side .
We were afraid for you , right?
Thanks to the arts of Elrond , you're slowly recovering .
Welcome to Bruchtal , Frodo Beutlin .
Hello , Frodo , my boy .
Back and forth :
The story of a Hobbit . By Bilbo Beutlin .
That's wonderful .
I wanted to return , see the wonders of Dark Forest , visit sea town , see the Lonely Mountain again .
But as it seems , I'm finally getting old .
I miss the Auenland .
In my childhood I pretended I wanted to leave .
Away with you , experience adventures together .
My own adventure then looked quite different .
I'm not like you , Bilbo .
My dear boy .
What did I forget?
You've already packed?
I just wanted to be prepared .
- You wanted to see the Elves .
- That's right .
- More than anything .
- Yes , I do .
It's just
We did what Gandalf wanted , didn't we?
We brought the ring to Bruchtal .
I thought , as soon as you get better , we leave .
Home .
You're right , Sam .
We have done what we should do .
The ring will be safe in Bruchtal .
I'm ready to go home .
He's coming back to power .
The wound will never heal completely .
He carries them with him as long as he lives .
Nevertheless , he has come far with the ring and has shown himself extremely resistant to evil .
This burden should never have been imposed on him .
That's all you can ask of him .
The enemy is approaching .
Sauron's force is in the east .
His eye looks at Bruchtal .
And Saruman must have betrayed us .
The list of our followers is short .
His betrayal goes deeper than you know .
Through lazy magic , Saruman has crossed orcs with bilwiss people .
He breeds an army in the dungeons of Isengart .
An army that also progresses quickly and far in the sunlight .
Saruman wants to get the ring .
Even the power of the Elves is not up to evil .
We lack the strength to fight Mordor and Isengart!
The ring can't stay here .
This threat concerns the whole of Middle Earth .
You must now decide how we meet her .
The time of the Elves is over .
My people are leaving these shores .
Who will you turn to then?
To the dwarfs?
They are looking for wealth in the mountains .
The needs of others do not care .
We have to put our hope in people .
Humans .
People are weak .
The people of the people are failing .
The blood of Númenor is powerless , all his pride and dignity forgotten .
The human because of the ring survives the time .
I was there , Gandalf .
I was there 3000 years ago . When Isildur took the ring .
I was there when the strength of the people failed .
Isildur , hurry!
Follow me .
I led Isildur to the heart of the Fate Hill , where the ring had been forged .
Only there could he be destroyed . Throw him into the fire!
Destroy him!
At that time it should have ended , but the evil was allowed to persist .
Isildur kept the ring .
The line of kings is interrupted .
There is no more strength in the world of men .
They are scattered , disputed , unguided .
Only one could unite them .
One who could climb the throne of Gondor again .
He left this path a long time ago .
He chose exile .
The bristled sword Narsil .
The blade which cut the ring of Sauron's hand .
She's still hot .
Just a broken heirloom .
Why do you fear the past?
You are Isildur's heir , not Isildur himself .
You're not tied to his fate .
The same blood flows through my veins .
The same weakness .
Your time will come .
You will face the same evil .
And you will defeat it .
The shadow has no power yet .
Neither about you nor about me .
Do you remember our first encounter?
I felt put into a dream .
Long years have passed since then .
At that time , you did not worry .
Remember what I said back then?
You said you would enter into the covenant with me and thereby renounce the immortality of your people .
And I hold on to that .
Better a single life with you than all the ages of this world alone .
So I choose a mortal life .
You can't give me that .
You've been called here to defy Mordor's threat .
Middle earth is on the verge of destruction .
No one can escape it .
Burn yourselves , or you'll go down .
Every people is at the mercy of this fate , on prosperity and corruption .
Get out the ring , Frodo .
So it's true .
He's a gift .
A gift to the adversaries of Mordor .
Why not use it?
For a long time my father , the deception of Gondor , has resisted Mordor's force .
With the blood of our people we defend your countries .
Give Gondor the enemy's weapon .
Let's use them against him .
You can't use it .
No one can .
The One Ring obeys Sauron alone .
He's the only one who can control him .
And what does a forest runner understand of such things?
He's more than that .
This is Aragorn , Arathorn's son .
You're committed to loyalty to him .
So this is Isildur's legacy?
And heir to the throne of Gondor .
Sit down , Legolas .
Gondor has no king .
Gondor doesn't need a king .
Aragorn is right .
We can't use it .
There is only one way .
The ring must be destroyed .
What are we waiting for?
The ring cannot be destroyed , Gimli , Glóin's son , by any art we master .
Created in the fires of the Fatesberg , it can only be destroyed there .
You have to take him deep to Mordor and throw him back into the fiery chasm from which he came .
One of you has to do this .
You don't just walk for Mordor .
Its black gates are guarded by worse than just Orcs .
Evil there never sleeps .
And the Great Eye is always vigilant .
It is a barren wasteland , covered with fire , ash and dust .
The air that you breathe is poisonous steam .
You couldn't do it with 10 ,000 men .
It's madness .
Did you not hear Mr . Elrond?
The ring must be destroyed .
And you probably think it's you who does this!
And if it fails now? If Sauron takes what belongs to him?
Rather I want to die than see the ring in the hands of an elve!
No one trusts an Elves!
Do you not understand?
While you're poking around , Sauron's power is growing!
No one escapes her!
You'll all be destroyed!
I'll take it .
I'll take the ring to Mordor .
Although I don't know the way .
I help you to carry the burden as long as it may be imposed on you .
If I can protect you by life or death , I will .
You have my sword .
And you have my bow .
And my axe .
You determine our destiny , kid .
If this is the will of the Council , Gondor will join .
Mr . Frodo is not going anywhere without me .
It is hardly possible to separate you , even if he is invited to a secret consultation and you are not .
We'll come with you too!
Or you'll have to send us home tied up in a bag .
You need people with mind for this task .
Search .
Thing .
Well , you'll get out of here , Pip .
9 Companions .
So be it .
You form the community of the ring .
Great .
Where are we going?
My old sword .
Stitch .
Take it .
It's so easy .
Yes .
The Elves have forged it .
The blade shimmers blue when orcs are nearby .
And in times like this , boy , you have to be particularly careful .
Here's something nice .
Mithril .
Light as a feather and hard as a dragon tank .
Put it on .
My old ring .
I would very much like to hold him again - one last time .
I'm sorry I put that on you .
I'm sorry you're carrying this burden now .
I'm sorry about everything .
We have to follow the Rfad west of the Fog Mountains for 40 days .
If we are lucky hold , the forte of Rohan will be open to us .
From there we turn east towards Mordor .
Good!
Very good .
Move your feet .
Not bad at all , Pippin .
Faster!
If someone asked me for my opinion , what apparently nobody does , I would suggest , we make a detour .
We could go through the mines of Moria .
My cousin Balin would receive us royal .
No . I would only go through Moria , I would have no other choice .
To him!
- For the Auenland!
- Hold him tight , Merry!
What's that?
Just a bit of a cloud .
It moves fast , though .
And against the wind .
Crebain from Dunland!
Hide!
Cover!
The scouts of Sarumans .
They're watching the way south .
We have to take the pass of Caradhras .
A strange skill makes us endure so much fear and doubt because of such a small thing .
Such a little thing .
Give Frodo the ring .
Suit yourself .
I don't care .
Well , Gandalf , you're trying to guide her across the Caradhras .
And if that fails , which way do you choose?
When the mountain conquers you , you dare an even more dangerous path!?
There are cruel voices in the air .
That's Sarunam!
He's bringing the mountain down .
We have to turn back!
No! No!
We have to leave the mountain!
On to the gate of Rohan! And via the West-Fold to my city .
The gate of Rohan leads us too close to Isengart!
We can't cross the mountain .
Let's go under him .
Let's go through the mines of Moria .
You're afraid of these mines .
The dwarfs have been too greedy and too deep .
You know what they woke up in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:
Shadow and flame .
Let the ring bearer decide .
We're going through the mines .
So be it .
The walls of Moria .
Well , let's see .
Ithildin .
It only reflects starlight or moonlight .
It says here: The doors of Durin , the Lord of Moria .
Speak , friend , and step in .
What does that mean?
If you are a friend , say the slogan , and the door will open .
Mines are no place for a pony .
Not even for the brave Lutz .
Goodbye , Lutz .
Off you go .
Don't worry , Sam . He knows the way home .
Don't screw up the water .
No , it's pointless .
It's a mystery .
Speak , friend and step in .
What's the name of Freundauf elbisch?
Mellon .
Soon , Elbenherr , you get to know the famous hospitality of the dwarfs .
Strolling fireplace , malt beer , well hung meat!
This , my friend , is the home of my cousin Balin .
And they call it a mine .
A mine!
This is not a mine .
It's a grave .
They were Bilwiss people .
To the gate of Rohan .
We'd never have come here .
Let's get out of here .
Out!
Into the mines!
Legolas!
Run!
We have only one option left .
We have to take up Moria's long darkness .
Be on your guard!
There are even older and meaner creatures than Orcs in the depths of the world .
Shut up now .
We need 4 days to the other side .
Hopefully our presence remains unnoticed .
That's where I don't remember .
- Are we lost?
I think so .
Gandalf thinks about it .
- What is it?
- I'm hungry .
There's something down there .
This is Gollum .
He's been following us for three days .
He escaped from the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
Escaped or was released .
He hates and loves the ring , just as he hates and loves himself .
His desire for him will never be extinguished .
A pity that Bilbo didn't kill him then .
It was pity that Bilbo's hand held back .
Many who live , deserve death .
Some who die deserve life .
Can you give it to them , Frodo?
Don't be so quick with a death sentence at hand .
For even the wise do not recognize all intentions .
My heart tells me that Gollum still has a role to play - for the good or for the bad - before everything ends .
Bilbo's pity may determine the fate of many .
I wish I had never gotten the ring . And all this would never have happened .
That's what all who experience such times do .
But they can't decide .
We just have to decide what to do with the time that is given to us .
There are other forces at work , not only the forces of evil .
Bilbo was looking to find the ring , just as you were looking to have it .
And that's an encouraging thought .
That's the way .
- He remembers .
But here the air doesn't smell like that .
In case of doubt , Meriadoc , always follow your nose .
Let me dare a little more light .
Look! The great kingdom and the city dwarf beck .
A true eye opener , no question .
Here rests Balin , Fundin's son , Lord of Moria .
So he's dead .
I had feared it .
We have to keep going .
We can't stay .
They took the bridge and the 2nd hall .
We've locked the gates , but can't hold them for long .
The earth trembles .
Drums . Drums in depth .
We can't go out .
A shadow moves in the darkness .
We can't go out .
They're coming .
Naughty Tuk!
Throw yourself into it , so you don't prepare us any more trouble .
Orcs .
Stay behind Gandalf!
They have a cave troll .
Let them come!
There is a dwarf in Moria who still breathes .
I guess I'm starting to get the hang of it .
Oh , no .
He's alive .
I'm all right .
I'm unharmed .
You should have been dead .
The shock would have impaled a wild boar .
There's more to this Hobbit than the eye sees .
Mithril .
You are full of surprises , Mr . Beutlin .
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm .
What is this new devilishness?
A Balrog .
A demon of the old world .
This enemy is superior to all of you .
Run!
Quick!
Keep them going , Aragorn .
The bridge is close .
Do as I say!
Swords are no longer useful here .
No one throws a dwarf .
Not on the beard!
Careful!
Wait!
Hold on!
Bend forward!
Careful .
Over the bridge!
Run!
You can't pass!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire , Master over the flame of Anor .
The dark fire will do you no good , flame of Udûn!
Go back into the shadows .
You can't pass!
Flee , you fools .
No! No!
Legolas , up with them .
Give them some time!
When it gets dark , it's teeming with orcs .
We have to go to the forests of Lothlórien .
Come on , Boromir .
Legolas , Gimli , help them on .
Get up , Sam .
Stay close , young Hobbits!
They say a great sorcerer lives in these woods .
An elbenhexe of appalling power .
All who see them , succumb to their spell .
And will never be seen again .
You come to us as a harbinger of fate .
You bring evil to us , ring bearer .
After all , here's a dwarf that she can't cover so easily .
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox .
The dwarf breathes so loud , we could have shot him in the dark .
Haldir of Lórien .
We come to ask for help .
We need your protection .
These forests are dangerous!
We should turn back!
You have entered the kingdom of the mistress of the forest . You cannot turn back .
Come on .
She's waiting for you .
Here are 8 . 9 have broken from Bruchtal .
Tell me , where is Gandalf?
Because it requires me very much to talk to him .
He fell into the shadows .
Your ride is on knife's edge .
Only a few fail , and it will fail , which means the demise of all .
And yet there is hope as long as the community is faithful .
Don't let your heart be hard on you .
You shall rest , you are exhausted after so much grief and plague .
Tonight you sleep in peace ...
Welcome , Frodo from the Auenland , who has seen the eye .
A lament for Gandalf .
What do they say about him?
My heart cannot translate .
For me , the grief is still too close .
Sleep a little .
These boundaries are well protected .
I can't sleep here .
I heard her voice in my head .
She spoke of my father and the case of Gondor .
She said: Even now there is still hope .
But I don't see them .
It's been a long time since we hoped .
My father is a noble man , but a weak ruler , and our ... our people lose confidence .
I'm supposed to turn everything for the good for him . I would .
I would lead Gondor back into the light .
Have you ever seen him , Aragorn?
The White Tower of Ecthelions?
Glittering like a thorn of pearls and silver .
Its banners , shining in the morning wind .
Have you ever heard the bright sound of silver trumpets?
I saw the White City a long time ago .
One day our way will lead us there .
And from the tower the call will sound:
The Lords Gondors have returned .
Are you looking in the mirror?
What am I going to see?
That even the wisest doesn't always know , because the mirror shows many things .
Things that were . Things that are . And things ,
I know what you saw .
I perceive the same thing .
The thing that will happen when you fail .
The Community is disintegrating .
It has already begun .
He will try to take him .
You know who I'm talking about .
One by one he will destroy them all .
If you ask him , I will give you the One Ring .
You give it to me voluntarily?
I do not deny that my heart has desired this very much .
Instead of a Dark Ruler you would have a Queen , not dark , but beautiful and appalling as the morning!
Tricky as the sea!
Stronger than the earth's foundations!
Everyone will love me and despair .
I pass the exam .
I'm gonna get weaker and go to the West
and Galadriel remain .
I can't do this alone .
You're a ring bearer , Frodo .
To wear a ring means to be alone .
This task is for you .
And if you can't find a way , no one will find it .
Then I know what I have to do .
It's just - I'm afraid of it .
Even the smallest can change the course of fate .
Do you know how the Orcs saw the light of day?
They were once elves , but they were tortured and mutilated by the Dark Forces .
A destroyed and terrible life form that now
is completed .
My fighting Uruk-hai! Who do you serve?
Saruman .
Hunt them!
Until you find her!
You know neither fear nor pain .
You will taste human flesh!
One of the half-lings carries something very valuable .
Bring them to me alive and unharmed .
Kill the others .
I give you the light of Eärendil , our beloved star .
May it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out .
The Argonath .
Finally I see the kings of the ancient forefathers .
My ancestors .
We cross the lake at night , hide the boats and hike further .
We're approaching Mordor from the north .
So we just have to fight through the Emyn Muil , a maze of razor-sharp rocks .
And after that it gets even better!
Schwärende , stinking swamp landscape , as far as the eye can see .
This is our way .
Sleep a little and recover , Mr . Dwarf .
Refresh!
Let's get out of here .
No . No .
Orcs guard the eastern shore .
Let's wait until it's dark .
I'm not worried about the east bank .
A menacing shadow seizes mine .
Something's coming up .
I can feel it .
A dwarf doesn't have to recover .
Just don't mind , young Hobbit .
Where's Frodo?
No one should be alone .
Especially you .
So much depends on you .
I know why you're looking for loneliness .
You're tormenting yourself .
I see it day after day .
Don't you feel unnecessarily tormented?
There are other ways , Frodo .
Other paths we can choose .
I know what you're saying .
It would be wise , my heart did not warn me .
Did you warn?
From what?
We're all scared , Frodo .
But by fear of destroying the few in hope , is madness .
There is no other way .
I just want the strength to defend my people!
Can you lend me the ring ...
No! No!
I'm not a thief .
You're not yourself .
What prospects do you have?
They'll find you .
You take the ring .
And you will beg for death!
Son of a bitch!
An unfortunate coincidence gave it to you!
He could have been mine .
He should be mine!
Give it to me!
- Give me that!
- No , I'm not .
I know what you have in mind .
You want to bring Sauron the ring!
You want to betray us!
You run into death's arms and bring it over all of us!
I curse you!
You and all the halflings!
What have I done?
Please , Frodo .
Frodo , I'm sorry!
He took possession of Boromirs .
Where's the ring?
Stay away!
I swore to protect you .
Even in front of yourself?
Would you destroy him?
I would have gone with you to the end .
All the way to Mordor's fire .
I know .
Take care of the others .
Especially Sam .
He won't understand .
Go , Frodo .
Run!
Find the halflings!
Aragorn , run!
Hide here!
Come on!
What's he up to?
He's leaving us .
No! No!
Run , Frodo .
Hey , you guys!
Here we are!
Here!
It's working!
I can see that!
The Horn of Gondor .
Run!
You have the little ones!
Hold still .
Where's Frodo?
I let him move .
You did what I couldn't .
I wanted to take the ring away from him .
The ring is now unattainable .
Forgive me .
I couldn't have guessed .
I betrayed you all .
No , Boromir .
You fought bravely .
You've kept your honor .
Don't .
It's over .
The world of men will perish .
Everything sinks into darkness . My city falls into ruins .
I don't know what power I have , but I swear to you , neither falls the White City , nor fails our people .
Our people .
I would have followed you , my brother .
My captain .
My King .
Peace be with you , son of Gondor .
I wish I never had the ring .
And all this would never have happened .
That's what all those who experience such times do . But they can't decide .
You just have to decide what you start with the time that is given to you .
Frodo , don't!
No , Sam .
Go back , Sam!
I'm going to Mordor alone .
Of course .
And I'm coming with you!
You can't swim!
I promised , Mr . Frodo .
I promise .
Don't lose him , Samweis Gamjie .
And I won't .
I won't .
Come on .
Quick!
Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore .
You don't want to follow them .
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands .
Then everything was for nothing .
The Community has failed .
Not if we stick together faithfully .
We don't leave Merry and Pippin to torture and death .
Not as long as we still have power .
Leave everything you need here .
Just light luggage .
Let's hunt Orcs .
May the others find a safer way .
Streicher will take care of her .
We'll probably never see her again .
Perhaps still , Mr . Frodo .
Maybe it is .
I'm glad you're with me .
You can't pass!
Gandalf!
I am the servant of the Secret Fire , master of the flame of Anor .
Back in the shadows!
The dark fire will do you no good , flame of Udûn!
You can't pass!
No! No!
No! No!
Gandalf!
Flee , you fools!
No! No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What's wrong with you , Mr . Frodo?
Nothing .
I was just dreaming .
Can you see the floor?
No , don't look down , Sam!
Just keep climbing!
Catch it!
Pick up , Mr . Frodo!
Mr Frodo!
I think I found the ground .
Swamps and ropes and knows the cuckoo , what else .
That's not natural .
None of this!
- What's in there?
- Nothing . It's a bit of a spice .
In case we eat a roast chicken or something .
A roast chicken?
You never know .
Sam , my good Sam!
That's something very special .
The best salt in all of Auenland .
It's really something special .
A piece of home .
We can't leave this here , someone could follow us down .
Who should follow us down here , Mr . Frodo?
Really a pity , Mrs . Galadriel gave it to me .
Real Elves Rope .
Well , there's nothing you can do .
The knot comes from me .
I'm sure it won't work that fast .
Real , real elve rope .
Mordor!
The only place in Middle Earth that we don't want to see from close .
And that's exactly the place we're looking to get to!
But we can't get there .
Let's not fool ourselves , Mr . Frodo . We're lost .
I don't think Gandalf had planned this path for us .
There's a lot that he didn't plan , Sam . But it happened .
Mr Frodo?
It's the ring , isn't it?
He's getting harder and harder .
- What else do we have in food?
- Let's take a look .
Oh , yeah , delicious!
Lembas bread .
And the greatest ...
More Lembas bread .
I don't really like foreign cuisine like that , but this from the Elves is not bad .
Nothing can cloud your mood , can't it , Sam?
At most the rain clouds .
Somehow this seems familiar .
Because we've been here before .
We're walking around in circles .
What a horrible stench!
Here nearby must be a disgusting moor .
Do you smell that?
Yes , I smell it .
We're not alone .
The thieves .
The thieves!
The dirty little thieves!
Where is he?
They stole it from us , my dear .
Damn them , we hate them!
He is ours , yes , and we want him!
That's stab . You've seen it before .
Am I right , Gollum?
Let him go right now or I'll cut your throat .
It's burning!
It burns us!
It's freezing!
Garstige elves have turned it together .
- Take it off us!
- Shut up!
It's hopeless!
Every orc in all Mordor will hear this outcry!
We tie him up and then leave him here .
No , no , this will kill us , kill us!
You don't deserve anything else!
Maybe he really deserved death .
But now that I see him , I feel sorry for him .
We'll be nice to them if they're nice to us .
Take it off us!
We promise to do what you want from us .
We promise's!
You can't make a promise I can rely on .
We swear! We will serve him , the Lord of the Treasure!
We will swear on ... on ... on the treasure .
Gollum .
Gollum .
The ring is treacherous .
So stick to your word!
Yes . To the treasure .
To the treasure .
I don't believe you!
- Come down!
- Sam!
He's just trying to trick us!
If we let him go , he'll strangle us in our sleep!
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes .
You've been there before?
Yes .
Then you will lead us to the Black Gate .
To the gate!
To the gate , says the Lord!
Yes!
We don't want to go back!
Not there .
Not to him!
They can't force us .
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we have sworn to serve the Lord of the Treasure .
No! No!
Ash and dust and thirst is there . And caves , caves , caves!
And orcs! Thousands of orcs!
And always the Great Eye , alert and alert .
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He ran away , that crook!
So much for his promises!
This way , Hobbits , follow me!
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late .
Our Lord becomes impatient .
He wants the Auenland rats now .
I don't follow orders from Orkmaden!
Saruman will get his booty .
We will deliver them .
Merry!
Merry!
Wake up!
My friend is sick .
He needs water .
Please!
Is he sick?
Then he gets a little medicine , boys .
Stop it!
Can't take his train!
- Leave him alone!
- How?
Do you want something?
Then shut up .
Merry .
Hello , Pip .
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right .
- I was just pretending .
- Is that what you've done?
See?
You fell for it , too .
Don't worry about me , Pippin .
What's going on?
What do you smell?
Human flesh .
They're on our trail .
Aragorn .
Go on!
They march faster .
They must've weathered us .
Quick!
Come on , Gimli!
3 days and nights we follow them .
Without food .
Without rest .
And no sign of those we seek , except naked stone .
Not without purpose do Lórien's leaves fall!
Then maybe they're still alive .
And at most one day's march ahead .
Come on!
Come on , Gimli!
We'll catch them up!
I'm not needed to be cross-country .
We Dwarves are more born Spurter .
Murder dangerous over short distances .
Rohan .
Home of the horsemen .
Strange things are at work here .
Something evil gives these creatures speed and directs his will against us .
Legolas!
What does your Elbe Eye see?
Their trail leads to the north-west .
The Uruks bring the Hobbits to Isengart!
Saruman .
The world is changing .
Who is still standing up against the army of Isengart and Mordor?
Who stands up against the power of Sauron and Saruman and against the alliance of the two towers?
Together , Sauron , my master , we will reign over Middle Earth .
The Old World will burn in the fires of the melting furnaces .
The forests will fall .
A new order will emerge .
We will drive the war machine with sword and spear and the iron fist of the orcs .
I want to see her armed and ready to march in two weeks .
But , my lord , there are too many .
Until then , not all can be armed . We do not have the means .
Build a dam , stave the river , heat the ovens day and night!
We lack fuel , so many furnaces to heat .
The forest of Fangorn is at our door .
- Burn it down .
We fight for you .
Swear!
Let's go to death for Saruman!
The horsemen took your land!
Your people were chased into the mountains and now live on barren rock .
Killer!
Get back what you've been stolen! Burn everything down!
We just have to eliminate those who are against us .
In Rohan it will begin .
The farmers there have resisted you for too long .
This has now come to an end .
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister .
You're moving faster if you're just two .
Papa has forbidden Éothain to ride on Gárulf .
He's too big for him!
Listen to me!
You have to ride to Edoras and sound the alarm .
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes , Mama .
I don't want to leave .
I don't want to leave here , Mama!
Freda , I will soon follow .
Quick!
Ride , child!
Rohan , my lord , is on the verge of the case .
Théodred .
Seek the King's son!
- Mordor will pay for it with blood .
- These orcs aren't from Mordor .
My Mr . Éomer , over here!
He's alive .
Théodred .
Your son is severely wounded , my lord .
He was attacked by Orks .
If we don't defend our country , Saruman will take it forcibly .
That's a lie .
Saruman the White has always been our friend and ally , all over and ever since .
Gríma .
Gríma .
Gríma .
Orcs now roam freely through our country , undisturbed , unpunished , arbitrarily murdering .
Orcs with the sign of the white hand of Saruman .
Why are you complaining with worries about his already worried mind?
Don't you see?
Your uncle suffers greatly from your dissatisfaction and warmongering .
War-triggering?
How long has it been since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price , Gríma?
Your part of the loot , as well as all are eliminated?
You've been watching my sister for too long .
You've been watching her steps for too long .
You see a lot , Éomer , Éomund's son .
Too much .
From now on you are banished from the kingdom of Rohan and all its dominions . If you return , you are threatened with death .
You have no authority here .
Your orders don't mean anything .
Well , you're wrong , this is not an order from me .
He's from the King .
He signed it this morning .
Keep breathing .
That's the trick . Breathe!
Breathe!
They run as if the whips of their masters were behind them!
SARK 1: We'll go on only when we've taken a breather .
Kick a fire , let's go!
Merry!
Merry!
I think it was a mistake of us to leave the Auenland , Pippin .
What are those noises?
- Those are the trees .
Do you remember the Old Forest , on the border with Bockland?
Previously it was said that there was something in the water that makes the trees grow up and even makes them alive .
Live?
Trees that whisper , talk to each other and even move .
I'm starving .
Only this big bread and that for 3 stinking days!
Yes!
Why don't we get meat here?
How about them?
They're fresh .
They're not there to eat .
What about her legs?
They don't need them .
- Oh , they look delicious!
Back up , you worm!
The prisoners go to Saruman .
Live and unharmed .
Live?
Why alive?
Can you play with them?
You have something with you .
An elbian weapon .
The Lord needs them for war .
- You think we have the ring .
- Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh ,
If they find out that we don't have him , we're dead .
Chop them into pieces! Just a bite!
From now on there is meat again on the menu .
Pippin!
Come on , come on!
Go on!
Why don't you call for help?
Quiekt!
Now no one will be able to save you .
Pippin!
A red sun rises .
Blood was spilled tonight .
Your rider from Rohan , what's new in the Mark?
What do an elb , a man and a dwarf do here in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name , horse lord , then I will call you mine .
I'd cut your head off , dwarf , if he just stood a little higher above the ground .
You would die before you made out for pranks .
I'm Aragorn , Arathorn's son .
This is Gimli , Glóin's son , and Legolas from the Waldlandreich .
We are friends of Rohan and Théoden , your king .
Théoden can no longer distinguish friend from enemy .
Even his kinship he does not recognize .
Saruman has poisoned the spirit of the king and demands the rule of this land .
My squad consists of those who are faithful to Rohan .
And for that we were banished .
The White Wizard is listy .
He appears here and there , it is said , as an old man in hood and coat .
And everywhere his snitches slip through our nets .
We're not a snitch .
We track a group of Uruk-hai westwards across the plain .
You have captured two of our friends .
The Uruks are destroyed .
We killed everyone at night .
But there were 2 hobbits!
Have you seen two hobbits among them?
They would have been small , only children in your eyes .
We didn't let anyone live .
We put the carcasses on a pile and burned them .
You're dead?
I'm sorry .
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses meet you with a better skill than their last masters .
Farewell .
Look for your friends .
But make you no hope .
It's lost in these lands .
We ride north!
That's one of their belts .
We've let them down .
A Hobbit lay here .
And here's the other one .
They crawled .
Her hands were tied .
The shackles were cut .
Then they ran this way .
They were persecuted .
The belt!
Run .
The tracks lead away from the battle . To the Fangorn forest .
Fangorn?
What madness did she drive in there?
Did we lose him?
I think so , don't I?
I'll rip out your crappy little guts!
Come here!
Trees .
On a tree , Pippin!
He's gone .
Merry!
Now I'm drilling maggot holes in your mouth!
Run , Merry!
Little Orcs , burárum!
He speaks , Merry .
The tree speaks!
Tree?
I'm not a tree!
I'm a duck .
A tree herd .
A shepherd of the forest .
Don't talk to him , Merry!
Don't challenge him .
Treebeard some call me .
And whose side are you on?
Page?
I am on the side of no one . Because no one is on my side , little orc .
No one cares about the forest .
We're not orcs .
We're hobbits!
Hobbits?
I've never heard of a Hobbit .
Sounds to me like Ork-Teufelei .
They come with fire .
They come with axes .
Nagging , biting , breaking , hacking , burning!
Destroyer , invaders!
Curse over them!
You don't quite understand .
We're hobbits!
Halflings!
Auenland residents!
Maybe you are and maybe you are not .
The White Wizard will know .
The White Wizard?
Saruman .
Look!
Look!
We've guided you!
Hurry , Hobbitse .
Hurry up!
Great luck that we found you .
Nice Hobbit .
Oh!
A moor!
He led us into a swamp .
A swamp . Yes , yes .
Come on , Lord .
We'll take you on safe paths through the fog .
Come on , Hobbits!
Come on!
We're going fast .
I found him .
Yes .
The way through the swamps .
Orcs don't use it .
Orcs don't know him .
You walk miles and miles around it .
Come on , quick!
Quiet and fast like shadows we must be .
I hate this place .
Much too quiet here .
For 2 days no bird neither to see nor to hear .
No , no birds to eat .
No crispy birds!
We must starve , yes .
We must starve , my dear .
Here .
What is it that they eat?
Is it ... does it taste , yes?
He's trying to suffocate us!
We can't eat Hobbit food .
We must starve to death!
Then starve to death .
Then we finally got rid of you .
Oh , cruel Hobbit!
He doesn't care if we're hungry .
He doesn't care if we have to die .
Unlike the Lord .
The Lord cares .
The Lord knows .
Yes .
My darling .
Once he takes possession of us , he never lets you go again .
Don't touch me!
There's dead people!
Dead faces in the water!
All dead .
All rotted .
Elves and people and orcs .
A mighty battle . Long ago .
The swamps of the dead .
Yes , yes , that's her name .
This way .
Don't follow the lights .
Otherwise Hobbits go down to the dead and also light small candles .
Look out!
Frodo!
Gollum?
Don't follow the lights!
Gollum!
- Mr . Frodo!
Are you all right?
So beautiful .
So magnificent .
Oh , my darling ...
What did you say?
Lord should sleep now .
Lord must remain strong .
- Who are you?
- Can't ask us .
None of his business .
Gollum!
Gollum!
Gandalf said you were one of the river people .
Cold be hand , heart and bone . Cold , who travels far from home .
He said your life was a sad story .
He no longer sees what lies ahead of him , When Sonn'and Moon's light dwindles .
You were once not so dissimilar to a Hobbit , were you?
Sméagol .
What does it call me?
That used to be your name , right?
Very long ago .
My name .
Sméagol .
- Black riders!
Hide!
Come on , Frodo!
Come on!
Quick!
Or they'll see us!
See us!
- I thought they were dead!
- Dead?
No , you can't kill them . Impossible .
Ghosts!
Ghosts with wings!
They're calling for it .
They're calling for the treasure .
Mr . Frodo , don't be afraid!
I'm here .
Hurry , Hobbits .
The Black Gate is very close .
Orc blood .
These are strange traces .
The air is so stuffy here .
This forest is old .
Very old .
Full of memories and anger .
The trees , they talk to each other .
Gimli!
Set your axe!
You have feelings , my friend .
It was the Elves once ...
They have awakened the trees and taught them to speak .
Talking trees!
What could trees talk about , huh?
Except for the nature of squirrels .
There's something out there .
What do you see?
The White Wizard , he's approaching .
You must not let him speak , otherwise his spell blinds us .
We need to be quick .
You're tracking the tracks of two young hobbits .
Where are they?
You got through here . Yesterday .
They met someone they hadn't expected .
Is that comforting?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
That's impossible!
Forgive me .
I thought you were Saruman .
I'm Saruman .
More likely , Saruman , as he should be .
You fell!
By fire ... and water .
From the deepest dungeon to the highest peak I fought against the Balrog of Morgoth .
Until I finally threw down my enemy and smashed his shell against the side of the mountain .
Then darkness surrounded me and I wandered around without thought and time .
Above me the stars went and every day was as long as an age on earth .
But it wasn't the end .
Because life moved back inside me .
I was sent back until my task is accomplished .
Gandalf .
Gandalf?
Yes ...
That's what they used to call me .
Gandalf , the Grey .
That was my name .
Gandalf!
I'm Gandalf , the White .
And I will return to you at the turning point of the tides .
One stage of your journey is over , now follow the next .
War has come over Rohan .
We have to ride to Edoras , as fast as we can .
To Edoras?
This is not a small distance .
We heard nothing good from Rohan .
It's bad for the king .
Yes , and he won't be easy to cure .
Just say we walked all the way for nothing?
Should we leave poor Hobbits here in this gruesome , dark , dull , tree-contaminated ...?
I meant , wonderful , quite wonderful forest?
It was more than mere coincidence that led Merry and Pippin to Fangorn .
Many years has been slumbering here a great power .
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones , which initiates an avalanche in the mountains .
In one point you have not changed , dear friend .
- Hmm?
- You're still talking in riddles .
Something is about to happen that hasn't happened since the ancient times .
The ducks will wake up
- and realize that they are strong .
- Strong?
Oh , that's good .
So stop the nuisance , Mr . Dwarf!
Merry and Pippin are safe .
In fact , it's a lot more than you'll be soon .
This new Gandalf is even more grumpy than the old one .
This is one of the Mearas , unless my eyes are deceived by a spell .
Shadow fur .
He is the prince of all Roesers and by many dangers a faithful friend to me .
Eberesche , my
Bright test once in appearance
The summer wonderful
On your head hold A red and gold
So you carried up the crown
What a beautiful verse .
- Is it still very far?
- Bararum .
Don't be so hasty .
You may call it far .
My home lies deep in the forest , close to the roots of the mountain .
I promised Gandalf that nothing will happen to you and what I promise will happen .
I think you'll like the next one too .
It's a self-composition .
So ...
Dreaming the leaves In the canopy
Sleeping bork , branch and branch
When shady moss is green and cool
And the west wind invites
How I miss you
How I miss you
And say this country is mine .
Oh .
Sleeps , small foreigners .
Don't hear a nightly sound .
Sleeps until morning light .
I have to do now in the forest .
It is necessary to call many .
Many who have to come .
A shadow lies on Fangorn .
The withering of all forests is approaching .
The threatening shadow that lurks in the east is now taking shape .
Sauron won't tolerate a rival .
From the height of Barad-dür , his eye keeps waking .
But he is not yet so powerful that he is exalted above fear .
Ever the doubt of him gnaws .
He heard rumors .
The legacy of Númenor is alive .
Sauron fears you , Aragorn .
He fears what you might become .
That is why he will strike quickly against the world of men .
He will use Sarumans to destroy Rohan .
There will be war .
Rohan must defend himself and this is our first challenge . Because Rohan is weak and is on the verge of the case .
The king's thoughts are enslaved . A very old trick of Saruman .
His influence on King Théoden is now very strong .
Sauron and Saruman now pull the noose .
But as cunning as they may be , we have an advantage .
The ring remains hidden .
And that we could try to destroy him , that they do not imagine themselves even in their darkest dreams .
And so the enemy's weapon moves to Mordor .
In the hand of a hobbit she gets closer to the flames of the Fatesberg with every day .
We have to trust Frodo now .
Everything depends on him making rapid progress and keeping his undertaking secret .
You must not regret having left him .
He alone must complete this task .
He's not alone .
Sam's with him .
Oh , really?
Oh , really?
Good .
Yes . Very good .
The Black Gate of Mordor .
Oh , stand by us .
My old ohm would have a lot to say if he could see us now .
The Lord has said , show him the way to Mordor .
The good Sméagol does . The Lord has said's .
You're right .
Well , that's it , then .
We'll never get through that .
Look!
The gate!
It's opening!
There's a way down here .
Sam , no!
My lord!
- You don't have to come with me , Sam .
- I know , Mr . Frodo .
Even our elve coats won't be able to protect us in there .
- Now!
No! No!
No , sir!
They'll get you!
They'll get you!
Don't take him to him .
He wants it , the treasure .
He's always been looking for it .
And the treasure absolutely wants to go back to him .
But we can't let him get the treasure .
No! No!
There is another way!
A more secret .
A dark path .
- And why didn't you talk about it before?
- Because the Lord didn't ask anything .
He's up to something .
You say there's another way to Mordor?
There is a path and stairs .
And then a tunnel .
- He's taken us so far , Sam .
- Mr . Frodo , no!
But he swore an oath .
No . No .
Show us the way , Sméagol .
Good Sméagol always helps .
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where did he go?
I had a wonderful dream tonight .
From such a big barrel full of pipe herb .
And we smoked everything away .
And then you got sick .
What would I give now for a train old Tobi .
Did you hear that?
There it was again .
Something's wrong here .
And what's wrong with this?
You just said something in Baumisch .
No , not at all .
I was just stretching .
You're taller!
Who?
You!
- As what?
- When I did!
I've always been taller than you .
Pippin , that really everyone knows , I'm the big one and you're the little one .
Please , Merry!
How tall are you?
3 ft 6?
At most .
Whereas I am almost 3 ft 7 .
3 ft 8!
3 ft 8 .
You did something .
Merry , you ...
M ... D ...
Merry!
No , tree beard has said , you can't drink from it!
I want something , too!
- He said it could be dangerous!
Come on , give it to me!
Merry!
What's happening?
It's got my leg!
Merry!
No! No!
Help!
Get away from me!
You shouldn't be awake .
Eat earth .
Dig deep .
Drink water .
Go to sleep .
Go on with you .
Come . The forest is on awakening .
It's not safe here .
The trees have become wild and dangerous .
Anger ferments in their hearts .
Black are their thoughts .
Strong is their hatred .
They are evil if they can .
Oh , there are too few of us Ents .
Too few to deal with them .
If you've lived so long , why are there so few of you?
- Are there any de-children?
- Burárum .
Enttings has not existed for a long number of years .
- Why not?
- We've lost the dews .
I'm sorry about that .
- How did they die?
- Died?
No! No!
We lost her .
And now we can't find them again .
You didn't happen to see dews in the Auenland?
I can't honestly say that .
You , Pip?
What do they look like?
Um , I can't remember now .
Edoras and the Golden Hall Meduseld .
There lives Théoden , King of Rohan , whose spirit is broken .
Saruman's influence on King Théoden is now very strong .
My lord , your son , he is dead .
My lord?
Uncle?
Aren't you going to see him?
Don't you want to do anything?
Be careful what you say .
Don't expect you to be welcome here .
He must be different over the night .
How tragic for the king to lose the only son and heir .
I know , such farewell is not easy to accept .
Especially now that your brother has let you down .
Leave me alone , snake!
But you are alone .
Who knows what you entrust to the darkness , in the bitter hours of the night , when your whole existence seems to shrink ,
To you the walls of your chamber approaching , locked in a cage like wild beast .
So nice , so cool ...
Like a pale morning in spring , still breathed through by winter cold .
Your words are like poison .
At each cemetery the mood is more cheerful .
Ah!
I cannot let you be so armed to King Théoden , Gandalf Grey Skirt .
At the behest of Gríma snake tongue .
- Your staff .
- Hmm?
Oh ...
You don't want to take his support from an old man , do you?
My master , Gandalf , the Grey , has arrived .
He is a harbinger of suffering .
The courtesy in your hall has lately diminished somewhat , Théoden King .
He's not welcome .
Why should I welcome you , Gandalf Storm crows?
This is a very legitimate question , Lord and Master .
Late is the hour in which this magician enters the plan .
Láthspell should be called him!
Bad news is a bad guest .
Shut up!
Keep your split tongue behind your teeth .
I didn't go through fire and death and now I'm changing lying words with a simple worm .
His staff!
I have ordered you to take off the wizard's staff!
Théoden , Thengel's son! You've been sitting in the shade for too long .
If I were you , I wouldn't move right now .
Listen to me!
I release you from the spell .
You have no power here , Gandalf , the Grey .
I'll suck you out of Saruman like poison from a wound .
Wait!
When I go , Théoden dies .
You didn't kill me , you won't kill him either .
Rohan is mine .
Soft!
I know your face .
Éowyn .
Éowyn .
Gandalf?
Now breathe the fresh air again , my friend .
Dark have been my dreams lately .
Your fingers would better remember their old power if they grabbed your sword .
I have always served only you , my lord!
Your creative healing would have almost made me crawl on all fours like an animal!
Don't send me from your side .
No , sir!
Let him go .
Enough blood has already been shed because of him .
Get out of my way!
Salvation , Théoden , King!
Where's Théodred?
Where's my son?
Simbelmynë .
It has always grown on the hills of my ancestors .
Now it shall cover my son's grave .
Oh , that these dark days must be mine .
The boys die and the old ones remain .
That I'm still alive and see the last days of my house .
You're not to blame for Théodred's death .
No father should carry his child to his grave .
He was strong in life .
His soul will find the way into the halls of your fathers .
They were not warned , were unarmed .
Now wild people go through the Westfold and burn everything down .
Stall , Schober and Tree .
- Where's Mama?
Shh ...
This is just a foretaste of the horror that Saruman evokes .
The horror is even more effective , because Saruman is driven by the fear of Sauron .
Ride and offer him the forehead .
Lock him away from your wives and children .
You must fight!
You have 2000 capable men riding north at this moment .
Éomer is loyal to you .
They will return and fight for their king .
You'll be 300 miles from here by now .
Éomer can't help us .
I know what you expect of me , but I don't want any increased suffering among my people .
I don't want to risk an open war .
Open war is ahead of you whether you want to risk it or not .
As far as I can remember , Théoden , not Aragorn , was King of Rohan .
And what is the king's decision?
HÁ
We seek refuge in Helm's gorge .
Do not load yourselves with treasures .
Only the most necessary take with you on supplies .
Helm's clamp!
They flee to the mountains , although they should stay here and fight .
Who will defend them , if not their king?
He only does what he considers to be the best for his people .
Helms Klamm has saved her before .
There is no way out of this gorge .
Théoden runs into a trap .
He believes to bring his people to safety .
But it will end in a carnage .
Théoden has a strong will , but I fear for him .
I fear for Rohan's survival .
He'll need you before the end , Aragorn .
The Rohan people will need you .
Your defense must stand firm .
She'll hold .
The Grey Pilgrim , that's what they once called me .
Since 300 human lives I am already on this earth and now I have no time .
With a little luck , my search will not be for nothing .
Expect my coming at the first light of the fifth day .
At sunrise looks east .
Go on .
The stallion is foolish , sir .
It's pointless .
His name is Brego .
He was my cousin's horse .
Brego?
Your name is royal .
I have heard of the magic arts of the elves . But I would not have expected them with a forest runner from the north .
You speak like one of yours .
As a child I lived in Bruchtal . For a while .
Clear this one .
He's seen enough of the war .
Gandalf , the white man!
Gandalf , the fool!
Is he trying to humiliate me with his newly discovered piety?
There were 3 who followed the sorcerer .
An elb , a dwarf and a man .
You smell like a horse .
The human being ...
Was he from Gondor?
No , from the north .
Probably one of the Dúnedain forest runners , so it seemed to me .
Poorly dressed .
And yet , he wore a strange ring .
2 snakes with emerald eyes .
One devouring , the other crowned with golden flowers .
Barahir's ring .
Then Gandalf Graurock believes to have found Isildur's inheritance .
The missing King Gondor .
He's a fool .
This sex was extinguished years ago .
That's insignificant .
The world of men will perish .
It will begin in Edoras .
I'm ready , Gamling .
Bring me my horse .
This will not defeat .
We will return .
We will return .
You are skillful with the sword .
The women of Rohan have learned that those without swords can still die by a sword .
I fear neither death nor pain .
Then what do you fear , Mistress?
A cage .
To stay behind bars , until habit and old age accept it and all prospects to accomplish great deeds , irrevocable are gone .
You are a daughter of kings . A shieldmaid Rohans .
I don't think this will be your destiny .
Théoden won't stay in Edoras .
It's vulnerable .
He knows that .
He'll expect an attack on the city .
They flee to Helm's gorge , the great fortress of Rohan .
It is a dangerous path that you take through the mountains .
They'll be slow .
They will have women and children with them .
Send out your Warg-riders!
Hey , stinker! Don't go too far ahead .
- Why are you doing this?
- What?
You insult him .
Give him horrible names .
It's simple .
Because that's exactly what he is , Mr . Frodo .
There is nothing left in him but lies and betrayals .
He's after the ring .
He doesn't care about anything else .
You do not know how he has suffered under the ring . As he still suffers from it .
- I want to help him , Sam .
- Why?
He must be able to be the one he was again .
You can't save him , Mr . Frodo .
What do you know about that?
Nothing!
Sorry , Sam .
I don't know why I said that .
I do .
It's the ring .
You only have eyes for him!
I've been watching you .
You don't eat anything .
Don't tell me you're asleep .
He has taken possession of you , Mr . Frodo . Fight it!
I know what I have to do , Sam .
The ring has been entrusted to me .
That's my job!
Mine .
Mine alone!
Do you hear yourself talking?
Do you know how you sound?
We want him .
We need him .
We must have him , the treasure .
They stole the treasure from us .
Cheerful little Hobbitse .
Bad .
Tricky .
Wrong!
No . No .
No , the Lord .
Yes , my darling .
Wrong!
They cheat you , hurt you , lie!
The Lord is my friend .
You don't have any friends .
Nobody likes you!
I'm not listening .
I'm not listening!
You're a liar and a thief .
No . No .
Killer!
Go away!
You want me to go away?
I hate you!
Where would you be without me?
Gollum!
Gollum!
I saved us!
I did it .
We survived . Just because of me!
This is over now .
What did you say?
The Lord now takes care of us .
We don't need you .
What?
Get out of here and never come back!
No . No .
Get out of here and never come back!
Get out of here and never come back!
We told him to leave!
And he's gone , my darling!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Sméagol is free!
Look!
Look!
Look what Sméagol finds!
You're young .
They're tender .
You're nice!
Yes , they are .
Eat them .
Eat them!
You're making him sick with your behavior .
You can only eat rabbits in one way anyway .
What's it doing?
Stupid fat Hobbit!
It spoils them!
What are you going to spoil?
There's no meat on them anyway .
What would I give for a few vents .
What are fantasies , my dear?
What are Ventilations?
Hmm?
Kar-tof-feln .
You cook them , stamp them , put them in the soup .
Delicious , frying , golden frying potatoes and a piece of baked fish .
Not even one like you could say no to it .
Oh , yes , we could .
Broke the nice fish .
Give it to us , raw and zapping .
Keep some fried potatoes!
I give it up .
Mr . Frodo , where are you?
Who are they?
Bad people .
Servant of Sauron .
They call for Mordor .
The Dark engulfs all armies .
Won't be long now .
He'll be ready soon .
Ready for what?
Ready for his war .
The last war that will cover the whole world with shadows .
We should go on now .
Come on , Sam .
Mr Frodo!
There!
Olifants!
No one will believe us at home .
Sméagol?
We stayed here far too long .
Come on , Sam .
No! No!
Wait!
We're innocent walkers!
There are no hikers in this country .
Only the servants of the Dark Tower .
We are committed to a secret order .
Those who claim to be against the enemy would do well not to stop us .
The enemy?
His sense of duty was in no way inferior to yours , I mean .
One wonders what his name was and where he came from .
Whether he really had a bad heart .
What lies or threats have led him to the long march out of his home country .
Whether he would not have preferred to stay there . in peace .
The war makes corpses of all of us .
Tie their hands .
It's true , many dwarf women you don't see .
In addition , they are so similar to us in voice and appearance that they are often thought to be male dwarfs .
That's because of the beards .
And from that again the fallacy arose , that there are no dwarf women at all . And that dwarfs just slip out of earthholes! Which is of course ridiculous .
It's okay , it's okay .
Just don't panic .
That was intentional .
That was intentional .
It's been a long time since I saw my niece smile .
She was still a child when her father was brought home dead , killed by orcs .
She watched her mother break in grief .
Then she was alone and used her king with growing fear .
For that damned to take care of an old man who should have loved her like a father .
Gimli .
Uh , no , that's ...
Thank you .
I made a stew .
It's not much , but it's hot .
Thank you .
- All right .
- Really?
My uncle told me something strange .
He said you went to war , with Thengel , my grandfather .
But he must be wrong , I think .
The King's memory is good .
He was still a little kid back then .
Then you must be at least 60 .
70?
You can't be 80!
87 .
You're one of the Dúnedain .
A descendant of the Númenor , who are blessed with long life .
It is said that your sex has entered the realm of legend .
Only a few of us are left .
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed a long time ago .
I'm sorry .
Please , eat .
The light of the evening star does not increase or decrease .
It's mine , so I can give it to whoever I want .
Like my heart .
Sleep now .
I'm sleeping .
This is a dream .
Then it's a good dream .
Sleep .
You once told me that this day will come .
This is not the end , it is the beginning .
You have to go with Frodo .
This is your way .
My path is hidden from me .
He's already laid at your feet .
Finally , don't hesitate .
Arwen ... If you trust nothing else , trust this ,
Where is she?
The woman who once gave you this jewel?
Our time here is over .
And even Arwen's time is running out .
Let her go .
Let them sail west with the ship .
Let her take your love with her to the Immortal Lands , where she stays forever young .
But nothing more than memory .
I won't let Arwen die here .
- She only stays here because she still has hope .
- She's staying because of you .
But she is one of her people .
And so you're going to say goodbye now?
Did you think you could sneak away unnoticed at dawn?
I will not return .
You underestimate your war fortune .
You will return .
I'm not talking about death on the battlefield .
Then what are you talking about?
You have the prospect of a different life , far from war , grief , despair .
Why do you say that?
I'm mortal .
You Elbian blood .
It was a dream , Arwen .
Nothing more .
I don't believe you .
It's yours .
It was a gift .
Keep it .
My lord?
She sails to the Immortal Lands , with all who are left of her people .
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure .
Warge!
A scout!
- What did you see?
- Warge!
They're attacking us!
All riders to the top of the train!
Come on , lift me up .
I'm a rider .
Come on , let's go!
You have to lead the people to Helm's gorge and quickly!
- I can fight!
- No , no , no , no , no .
You have to do this for me .
Follow me!
Hey!
Forward!
I mean , storm forward!
Run into the valley!
All right!
Come on!
Stay together!
My axe is waiting for your face!
He's on my bill!
Stinking creature!
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened , then I will ease your farewell .
He's dead .
He just fell off the cliff over there .
You're lying!
The wounded on the horses .
The wolves Isengarts will return .
Leave the dead here .
Come on .
Finally there!
Helm's clamp!
We did it .
We're safe , Mistress!
Mom!
Éothain!
Freda!
- Where's the rest?
- That's all we could take , Mistress .
Well , get everything into the caves .
Make room for the king!
Make room for Théoden!
Make room for the king .
So few .
So few have returned .
Our people are safe .
We have paid with many lives for it .
Mistress .
Mr . Aragorn ... where is he?
He fell .
Pull all our forces behind the wall!
Lock the gate!
Set up posts!
What happens to those who cannot fight , my master?
With the women and children?
Take her to the caves .
Saruman's arm must indeed have become long , if he thinks we can reach us here .
Helms Klamm has a weak spot .
Its outer wall is made of solid stone . But there is a small passage further down , hardly more than a drain shaft .
How?
How does fire destroy stone?
What elixir is capable of bringing down the wall?
If the wall is breached , Helms Klamm falls .
Even if you break it through , an unimaginable number would be needed , thousands to storm the fortress .
Tens of thousands .
But , my lord , there is no such force .
A new power rises .
And their victory is near!
Tonight the land is stained with Rohan's blood!
Let's go to Helms Klamm!
Don't let anyone live!
Forward!
There is no tomorrow for humanity .
Look!
In the south , smoke rises!
Well , there's always smoke rising from Isengart these days .
In the past , Saruman often wandered in my forests .
Now he only has metal and wheels in mind .
He no longer cares about growing creatures .
What's that?
This is Saruman's force .
The war has begun .
May the favor of the Valar protect you .
Brego .
Arwen .
It's time .
The ships sail to Valinor .
Go now before it's too late .
I've made my choice .
He will not return to you .
Why are you still here when there's no hope?
There is still hope .
If Aragorn survives this war , you will still be separated .
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn is king and everything you hoped for has been fulfilled , he will nevertheless experience bitterly the lot of mortality .
Whether by the sword or slow decay , one day Aragorn dies .
And there will be no consolation for you , no consolation , to relieve the pain of his vagina .
He will come to death . An image of all the splendor of the human kings in their unclouded splendor before the world broke apart .
But you , my daughter , you will continue to dawn in the dark and in doubt , like the winter night sky without star .
Here you will live your existence , bound to grief under dwindling trees . So long until the world changes and all your years of life is spent .
Arwen .
There's nothing here for you , just death .
Don't I own your love too?
You own my love , Father .
The power of the enemy is growing .
Sauron uses Saruman as a puppet to destroy the Rohan people .
Isengart was unleashed .
The eye of Sauron is now directed to Gondor , the last free kingdom of men .
His war against this country will come up quickly .
He feels that the ring is close .
The force of the ring bearer is fading .
Deep in his heart Frodo begins to understand that the task demands his life .
You know that .
You have foreseen it .
We have all taken this risk .
In the approaching darkness the will of the ring strengthens .
At all costs he seeks the way back into the hands of the people , those people who so easily succumb to his power .
The young captain Gondors only needs to stretch out his hand , take the ring and the world will perish .
It is close , so close to achieving its goal .
For Sauron will command over all life on this earth . Even about the end of the world .
The time of the Elves is over .
Do we leave Middle Earth to ourselves?
Do we abandon them all?
What's new?
Our scouts report that Saruman attacked Rohan .
Théoden's people have fled to Helms Klamm .
But our own limits should worry us .
Faramir , Orcs are on the move .
Sauron sets up an army .
Eastlings and Southerners pass the Black Gate .
- How many?
- Several thousand .
Every day more come .
- Who's monitoring the river in the north?
- 500 men from Osgiliath .
If the city is attacked , we will not be able to hold it .
Saruman attacks from Isengart .
Sauron von Mordor .
People will have to fight on both fronts .
Gondor is weak .
Sauron will attack us soon .
And it will be a hard blow .
He now knows that we do not have the strength to defend him .
My men claim you're Ork-tips .
Snipers?
You're kidding me!
Well , if you're not a snitch , then who are you?
Speak!
We are Hobbits from the Auenland .
Frodo Beutlin is my name . And this is Samweis Gamjie .
Your bodyguard?
His gardener .
And where is your creeping friend?
This neglected creature?
Quite ugly , one might say .
We're on our own .
With 7 companions we set out from Bruchtal .
One we lost in Moria . 4 hobbits we were . A dwarf was also present .
And one Elb and two people:
Aragorn , Arathorn's son and Boromir from Gondor .
Are you a friend of Boromir's?
Yes .
I for my part already .
Then it grieves you to know that he is dead .
Dead?
Why?
When?
As one of his companions I hoped you would tell me .
If something happened to Boromir , you have to tell us .
His horn was flushed to the riverbank . About 6 days ago .
It was split into two parts .
But more than this my heart tells me .
He was my brother .
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom!
A hoard of light , of beauty and music .
And this is to become it now!
Let Mordor's forces be told:
Never again falls the land of my people in the hands of the enemy!
The city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed! For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Well spoken .
Nice and short .
So you have more time to drink .
Stitched the barrels!
The men here are thirsty!
Remember today , little brother .
Today life is beautiful .
What?
He's here .
He can't give us a moment of peace .
Where is he? Where is he? Where is Gondor's Best?
Where's my firstborn?
Father!
They say , almost alone you had defeated the enemy .
You're exaggerating .
Faramir has also made himself worthy of victory .
If Faramir had done his part , the city would still be .
Didn't you have the mission to defend her?
I would have defended them , but we were too few .
Too few?
You have formally invited the enemy to take over the city .
As so often you don't let me appear in a good light .
That's not my intention .
He tries to be your will and you never have any praise for him .
- He loves you , Father!
- Don't bother me with Faramir . I know about his strengths and there aren't many .
We have more urgent things to discuss .
Elrond von Bruchtal has convened a council .
He doesn't want to tell why , but I can think of the occasion .
There's a rumor that you've found the enemy's weapon .
The One Ring .
Isildur's curse .
He got into the hands of the Elves .
Everyone wants to seize his .
Humans , Dwarves , Wizards .
We must not let that happen .
This thing has to get to Gondor!
- After Gondor ...
- It's dangerous , I know .
Always the ring will try to corrupt the hearts of weak people .
But you , you are strong .
And our need is great .
It is our blood that has been shed ; our people who suffer death .
Sauron will first wait .
He makes masses of troops raise .
He will return .
And when this happens , we are much too powerless to then stop him .
You have to go!
Bring me this powerful gift .
No . No .
My place is here , with my people .
Not in Bruchtal!
- You refuse your own father?
- Is it necessary to ride to Bruchtal ,
- send me to his place .
- You?
Ah , I get it .
Now Faramir , the captain of Gondor , can show what he is worth .
I'd rather not .
I only entrust this assignment to your brother .
The one who will not disappoint me .
Remember today , little brother .
Sir Faramir!
We found the third one .
You have to come with me .
Now .
Down there .
Just coming here and looking at the Forbidden Consecration includes the death penalty .
They're waiting for my order .
Should I have a shot?
In cool ponds wool's we're going to steal
So juicy-sweet
And on the table comes a fish today
So juicy-sweet
Wait!
I am bound to this creature .
And it's me .
It's leading us .
Please , let me down to him .
Sméagol .
The Lord is here .
Come on , Sméagol!
Trust the Lord , yes?
Come on!
We have to get out of here now .
Sméagol , you must trust the Lord .
Follow me .
Come on!
Come on .
Come on , Sméagol!
Nice Sméagol .
That's it .
Come on!
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol , don't fight!
Trust me!
My lord!
That's enough .
Tell me where you're taking her .
Answer me!
Sméagol .
Why is Sméagol crying?
Cruel people hurt us .
Lord has set us up .
Of course he did .
I told you he's treacherous .
I told you he was wrong .
Lord is our friend .
Our friend!
Lord has betrayed us .
No! No!
It's none of your business!
Leave us alone!
Dirty little hobbits!
They stole it from us!
No . No .
No! No!
What did they steal?
My darling!
We have to get out of here .
You go .
Go on , go!
You can do this .
Use the ring , Mr . Frodo .
Just this time!
Put it on .
Become invisible .
I can't .
You were right , Sam .
You wanted to warn me , but ...
I'm sorry .
The ring takes possession of me , Sam .
If I put him on , he'll find me .
He sees it .
But , Mr . Frodo ...
So , this is the solution of all the puzzles .
Here in the wilderness I have you , 2 halflings , and a crowd of people under my command .
And the ring of power is now very close to me .
Now Faramir , the captain of Gondor , can show what he is worth .
No! No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone!
Don't you understand?
He must destroy him!
We're going to Mordor .
To the Fiery Mountain!
Osgiliath is under fire .
They're calling for backup .
Please!
He's carrying such a load!
You have to help him , please!
Master of the army?
We're leaving .
The ring will go to Gondor .
He's alive!
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'll kill him!
You're the smartest , the most cunning , the truly wildest lucky guy I've ever met!
Be blessed!
Gimli , where is the king?
You're late .
You look awful .
Hosts , do you say?
All Isengart is cleared .
How many?
10 ,000 head strong , at least .
10 ,000?
It is an army , bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of men .
At nightfall , they're here .
Let them come .
It is every man and every strong boy who is capable of weapons , until nightfall ready to fight .
We can secure the dam path and the gate from above .
No army has ever broken through the gorge wall or set foot in the Hornburg .
This is not a gang of brainless orcs .
That's Uruk-hai .
Their armors are thick and their shields wide .
I fought many wars , Mr . Dwarf .
I know to defend my own fortress quite .
They will burn against this fortress like water on rock .
Saruman's hordes will loot and burn treasure , but we've experienced that before .
Crops can be re-seeded , houses re-built .
Within these walls we will survive them .
You don't want to destroy Rohan's fields or villages .
They want to destroy Rohan's people , except for the last child .
Tell me what to do .
You see my men!
Her fighting spirit is almost extinguished .
If this is our end , then I want to make it an end that everyone will remember!
Send riders out , Lord!
You must ask for assistance .
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We're less fortunate with our friends than you are .
Our old alliances are history .
- Gondor will help .
- Gondor?
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed the circle around us?
Where was Gon ...?
No , my Lord Aragorn , we are alone .
Take the women and children to the caves .
We need more time to withstand a siege .
THÉODEN: We don't have time .
We're at war!
Secure the gate!
We Ents have not taken care of the wars of men and sorcerers here for a long time .
But now something will happen that has not happened since an age .
Entthing .
What's that supposed to be?
A gathering .
A gathering of what?
Birch .
Oaks .
Chestnuts .
Ash .
Good .
Good .
Good .
Many have come .
Now we have to decide whether the Ents will go to war .
Hurry up!
Go on , guys!
Hurry up!
We post the second row along the wall .
So the archers above the gate are supported .
Aragorn , you have to rest .
You're not of any use to us .
My lord , Aragorn!
I am divided to accompany the women into the caves .
An honorable task .
To look after the children , provide food and beds for the men?
This is anything but glorious!
My mistress , it will soon be necessary heroism without glory .
Then to whom will your people look , in the last defense?
Let me stand by your side .
It's not in my power to command that .
You don't order the others!
Nevertheless they fight beside you because they do not want to be separated from you .
Just because they love you .
I'm sorry .
Farmers , hoofsmiths , stable boys .
They're not soldiers .
Most have experienced too many winters .
Or too few .
Look at her!
They're afraid .
I see it in her eyes .
And they are about 300 ...
About 10 ,000!
There is more hope for them if they defend themselves here , instead of in Edoras .
Aragorn .
You can't win this fight .
They're all gonna die!
Then I will die as one of them!
Let him go , boy .
Let him grant .
Every villager who is able to lead a sword , was sent to the armory .
My master?
Who am I , Gamling?
You are our King , Lord .
And do you trust your king?
Your men , Lord , follow you to any end .
To any end .
Where are Horsemen and Ross?
And the horn , the widely resounding?
Long past , like rain in the forest
And wind in the branches .
In the shadow behind the mountains , the days in the west are sinking .
How could it come to this?
Hmm?
This has been going on for hours now .
They must have decided something by now!
Decided?
No . No .
We're just finished with the morning greeting .
But now it's in the middle of the night .
You can't take your time forever .
Just not so hasty .
We don't have time now!
Come on , hurry up .
Give me your sword .
What's your name?
Haleth , Háma's son , my lord .
The men say that we will not survive the night .
They say it's hopeless .
This is a good sword ,
Haleth , Háma's son . Hope always exists .
We always trusted you .
You've never misled us .
Forgive me .
I shouldn't have doubted .
There's nothing to forgive , Legolas .
If we had time , I'd have this thing changed .
It's a little tight around the chest .
It's not an ork horn .
Send for the king .
- Open the gate!
Open the gate!
How is that possible?
I bring customer of Elrond von Bruchtal .
Once there was an alliance between Elben and humans .
Long ago we fought and died side by side .
This alliance is now being renewed .
You are truly welcome .
Back with the people to go to battle , fills us with pride .
You could really have picked a better place .
Well , boy , which may bring you luck , it may last the night .
Your friends are with you , Aragorn .
They too may survive the night .
Show no mercy , for you will not know either .
- What's happening out there?
- Well , I could describe it to you .
Or should I get you a box?
Hold on!
So then it starts .
Get ready!
Their armor is weak on the neck and under the arm .
Arrows off!
Did they hit anything?
Send an arrow hail .
- Arrows off!
- Arrows off!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
I've already got two!
- I'm at 17!
I'm not going to be surpassed by a pointed ear! Hua!
19!
Merry!
We have just agreed .
Yes?
I told the Entthing your names and we agree: You are not Orcs .
That's good news .
But what about Saruman?
Have you made a decision about him?
Don't be too hasty , Mr . Meriadoc .
Hastily?
Our friends are out there!
You need our help!
Alone they will not be able to win this war .
War?
Yes .
It affects us all .
Tree , root and branch .
But you need to know , young Hobbit , that it takes a lot of time to say something in the old Entish . And we only say something when it's worth spending so much time .
17!
18!
19!
20!
21!
The dam path!
Is that all?
These are your magic tricks , Saruman?
Take him down , Legolas!
Kill him!
Protect the gate!
Repel them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Attack!
The Ents can never ward off this storm .
We smell things like that , as we've always done .
This can never be your decision!
This is not our war .
But you are part of this world!
Or isn't it?
You have to help!
Please!
You have to do something .
You are young and brave , Mr . Merry .
But your role in this story is over .
Go back home .
Maybe Treebeard is right .
We don't belong here , Merry .
This is too big for us .
What can we do?
We have the Auenland .
We should go home .
The fires of Isengart will spread and the forests of Buckelstadt and Bockland will burn .
And ...
Everything that was once green and good in this world will pass away .
There will soon be no more Auenland .
Aragorn!
Pull back into the fortress!
Get your men out of there!
Into the castle!
Back to the castle!
Haldir!
Into the castle!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Haldir!
Protect the gate!
Stop them!
To the gate!
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We can't stand any longer!
Stop them!
- How much time do you need?
As much as you can give me .
Gimli!
Wooden beams!
Hold the gate!
Come on .
We'll make it .
That's pretty far .
Throw me .
- What?
- I can't jump that far .
You have to throw me .
But don't tell the Elb!
Not a word .
Barricade the gate!
Make way!
Makes for more attachment!
Watch out!
Another one up here!
- Up here!
Lock the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everyone back!
Tell them to withdraw .
Fall back!
They broke through!
The fortress is occupied!
Fall back!
Pull back!
Fall back!
Hurry!
In!
Everybody in!
Into the castle!
At the western edge of the forest I will leave you .
From there you can head north to your home .
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around!
- Turn around!
Take us south!
- To the south?
But then you pass Isengart .
Yes .
Exactly .
In the south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed .
The closer we are to the danger , the less can happen to us .
This is the last thing he expects .
That doesn't sound very obvious to me .
On the other hand ... you are very small .
Maybe you're right .
Yeah , so south .
Hold on , small foreigners .
I always like going south .
Somehow you have the feeling , you go downhill .
Are you crazy?
They'll catch us!
They won't .
Not this time .
Look!
Osgiliath burns .
Mordor has come .
The ring won't be able to save Gondor .
He only has the power to destroy .
Please let me go!
Quick!
Faramir!
You have to let me go!
Mmh , a few field mice that sometimes climb up on me and tickle me terribly .
The most comfortable they feel when they ...
Many of these trees were my friends .
Creatures I knew from nut and acorn on .
I'm sorry , treebeard .
They had their own voice .
Saruman!
A sorcerer should have more sense!
There is no curse in Elbish , Entish , or in the languages of men for such a betrayal .
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
You have something to do with the orcs .
My job tonight is Isengart , with rock and stone!
Yes .
Hrumm , hrumm , coming , my friends .
The Ents are going to war .
It's probably the way of our demise .
The last march of the Ents .
Faramir , the orcs have taken over the eastern shore .
They are far too numerous .
Until night we are overwhelmed .
Mr Frodo?
He's calling for him , Sam!
His eye soon caught me .
Hang in there , Mr . Frodo .
You can do it!
Take her to my father .
Tell him Faramir sends a powerful gift .
A weapon that will turn our skill in this war .
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
Why did your brother die?
He had sworn an oath to protect Frodo . And then he tried to take his ring off .
He tried to kill him!
Because of the ring , your brother went mad!
Watch out!
Mr Frodo?
They're here!
You've come .
Nazgûl!
Stay here .
Don't move .
Take cover!
The fortress is occupied .
It's over .
You told me the fortress would never fall as long as your people defended it .
They're still defending her .
They left their lives for it!
You're breaking through!
They're in front of the gate!
Is there no other way for women and children out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is a path .
It leads to the mountains .
But they don't get far .
The Uruk shark are too numerous .
All women and children should go to the mountain path .
- and barricade the entrance!
- So much death .
What can man do against such derisive hatred?
Ride out with me .
Ride out and fight!
For death and glory!
For Rohan!
For your people!
The sun is rising .
Expect my coming at the first light of the fifth day .
At sunrise looks east .
Yes .
Yes .
The horn helmet Hammerhands is supposed to sound in the gorge . One last time .
Yes!
This may be the hour , as we draw swords together .
Awful deeds awoke!
Let's go to anger! Let's go to destruction and bloody tomorrow!
To , Eorlingas!
Gandalf .
King Théoden stands alone .
Not quite .
Rohirrim!
Éomer!
For the king!
Yes!
Hit!
Good hit!
Break the dam!
Free the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on , little Hobbits!
What are you going to do?
Where are you going?
I'm's .
I , your Sam .
Don't you recognize your Sam anymore?
I can't do this , Sam .
I know .
This is all wrong .
Actually , we shouldn't be here at all , in this place .
But we're here .
It's like in the big stories , Mr . Frodo .
In those who were really important .
They were full of darkness and dangers .
Sometimes you didn't want to know the end , because , how could such a story go well?
How could the world be like before , when so much bad has happened?
Victory!
We won!
Even the darkness must soften .
A new day will come .
And when the sun shines , it will shine all the brighter .
These were the stories that remain in your memory that were significant .
Even if you were still too small to understand them .
But I believe , Mr Frodo , I understand now .
I know now .
The people in these stories always had the opportunity to turn around , just they didn't .
They went on because they believed in something .
What are we supposed to believe in , Sam?
There is something good in this world , Mr . Frodo .
And it's worth fighting for .
I think , now we understand each other , Frodo Beutlin .
You know the laws of your country , the laws of your father .
If you let them go , your life is forfeited .
Then it's forfeited .
Release her!
Not in the woods!
Stay away from the trees!
I count exactly
- 42 . - 42?
Oh , not so bad for a pointed-eared elf prince .
On my part , I'm sitting right on number 43 right now .
- 43 .
- He was already dead .
- He was still shrugging .
- He was still shrugging because I pushed my ax between his nerve strands!
He doesn't look very happy , does he?
Not at all satisfied , Merry .
Nevertheless , you certainly have a magnificent view from up there .
Oh , yes .
A first-class run house .
Even the servants should be excellent .
- What are you doing?
- Nothing .
Everything is as it should be . That's all .
Not quite .
I'm starving to death .
We would have to be lucky if we wanted to find something edible here .
There's probably only dead rats and moldy bread here .
Saruman's pantry!
- I don't trust my eyes!
- That's not true!
- Yes , it is!
- Longsheet!
The finest pipe herb in the South Quarter .
That fits exactly .
A barrel for each of us!
Wait!
- Shall we give some of that to treebeard?
No . No .
No . No .
Dead plants and all that .
I don't think he'd understand .
He could be a distant relative .
Oh , now I understand .
Just not so hasty .
Exactly .
Barrumm!
This is the old channel .
It runs below the river to the outskirts of the city .
The forest behind it will provide you protection .
Sir Faramir , you have shown what you are worth , Lord .
The Most High .
The Auenland must be truly magnificent , Mr . Gamdschie , where gardeners are highly honored .
What way do you take when you reach the forest?
Gollum says there is a path near Minas Morgul that leads up to the mountains .
Cirith Ungol?
Isn't that his name?
No , no .
- Yes!
- Frodo ... it's called , a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul .
- You can't go this way!
There is no other way .
The Lord has told us he must go to Mordor . So we have to try .
I have to .
Go , Frodo .
Go with the good wishes of all people .
Thank you .
May cruel death come upon you if you harm them .
Come on , don't be so comforting .
Mr . Frodo didn't want the forest runners to hurt you .
You know that , don't you?
He wanted to save you , you know?
Save me?
So don't be gratifying .
- Forgive and forget?
- No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
Gollum . Gollum .
Nice gentleman .
- Nice hobbits .
Very decent of you .
Really decent , Gollum .
Sauron's anger will be terrible , his retribution will follow quickly .
The battle for Helm's gorge is over .
The battle for Middle Earth has only begun .
Our hope now rests with 2 little hobbits , somewhere in the wilderness .
I'd like to know if we've ever appeared in songs or stories .
What?
I wonder if people ever say: Let's hear from Frodo and the ring .
I'll say yes!
This is one of my favorite stories .
Frodo was very brave , am I right , Papa?
Yes , my boy .
Of all Hobbits the most famous .
And that says a lot .
But you missed one of the main characters:
Samweis , the brave .
Tell us more about Sam .
Frodo wouldn't have gotten far without Sam .
Oh , Mr . Frodo , you're making fun of me .
I meant it .
I mean's also serious .
Samweis , the hearted one .
Sméagol?
We're not waiting for you!
Come on!
Sir .
Lord takes care of us .
Lord will not hurt us .
Lord has broken his promise .
Don't ask Sméagol .
Poor , poor , Sméagol .
Lord has betrayed us!
Ugly!
Tricky!
Wrong!
We're gonna turn his dirty little neck around!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the treasure and we will be the Lord!
But the fat Hobbit , he knows it .
Eyes are always vigilant .
Then we'll get it out of him!
Get his eyes out and he'll have to crawl!
Yes , yes , yes!
Kill them both .
Yes!
No , no!
It's too dangerous , it's too dangerous .
Where is he?
Where did he go?
- Hey , Gollum!
Where are you?
Sméagol?
We could let them do it .
Yes , she could do it .
Yes , my darling , she could .
And we'll take him as soon as they're dead!
As soon as they're dead .
Come on , Hobbits!
Long way to go .
Sméagol shows you the way .
Follow me .
The Lord of the Rings
Sméagol!
I got one!
I have a fish , Sméagol!
Come on , pull him up!
Déagol!
Déagol?
Déagol ...
Give us that , Déagol , my dear .
Why?
Because today is my birthday and I want's .
My darling .
We've been cursed .
Murderers have been called us .
We've been cursed and chased away!
Gollum , Gollum , Gollum!
And we cried , honey .
Weeped because we were so alone .
... let's lie down , it's nice and cool for the feet
And on the table comes today a fish , so juicy sweet .
And we forgot the taste of bread , the roar of trees , the caressing of wind .
We even forgot our name .
My ... darling!
Wake up!
Wake up , you sleeping hats!
We have to go!
We have to leave right now .
Didn't you sleep , Mr . Frodo?
I , on the other hand , far too much .
- I'm sure it's late .
- No , I'm not .
It's not even noon .
The days are getting darker .
Come on!
Must go!
No time!
Not until Mr . Frodo has eaten something .
No time to lose , fool!
Here .
And what about you?
No , I'm not hungry .
At least not on Lembas bread .
Sam!
All right .
We don't have that much anymore .
We have to make sure that we don't run out .
But you just eat , Mr . Frodo .
I've split it up .
That's enough .
For what?
For the way home .
Come on , Hobbitse!
Very close now .
Close to Mordor .
Nowhere safe here .
Hurry up!
I feel like I'm sitting at home in the Green Dragon after a hard day's work .
With the difference that you've never had a hard day's work .
Welcome , gentlemen , to Isengart!
Because of you they hunt you through the area and now they find you mossing and smoking! You young no-goods!
We sit in the field of victory and enjoy some well-deserved amenities .
The pickle meat is exceptionally good!
Poultrymeat?
Hobbits! We are under the command Baumbarts! He is the new administrator of Isengart .
Young Master Gandalf!
I'm glad you're coming .
Wood and water , stick and stone I can master .
But here it is necessary to deal with a magician , locked in his tower .
And there must remain Saruman , guarded by you , tree beard .
Let's cut his head off so that he'll finally be quiet!
No! No!
His power is dried up .
The dirt of Saruman is washed away .
Trees will return to live here .
Young trees .
- Wild trees .
With my bark!
Peregrin Tuk!
I'll take that , my boy .
Come on!
Tonight we commemorate those who have given their blood to defend this country .
- Hail the victorious dead!
- Heal!
I'm happy for you .
He's a glorious man .
You are both glorious men .
Not Théodes of Rohan has led our people to victory .
Don't listen to me .
You're young .
And tonight is for you .
You can look all year and yet find nothing better ,
Because nowhere does the beer taste as good as's at home .
Keep bock and ale , close the noble drops!
Because , the real ornament , that's what I'm saying here ,
Is the Green Dragon Hops!
- Thank you!
No message from Frodo?
Not a word .
Nothing .
We have time .
Every day Frodo gets closer to Mordor .
Do we know that?
What does your heart tell you?
That Frodo is alive .
Yes .
Yes , he's alive .
Too dangerous .
Too dangerous .
Thieves!
They stole it from us .
Kill her .
Kill them . Kill them both!
Quiet!
Can't wake her up .
Can't spoil it now .
But they know!
They suspect us!
What does that mean , my dear , my dear?
Is Sméagol losing his nerves?
No . No .
Don't .
Never!
Sméagol hates nasty hobbits .
Sméagol sees her most dearly ... dead .
And we will .
Sméagol has done it before .
He can do it again .
He's ours!
Ours!
We have to get the treasure back!
Patience!
Patience , my dear .
First we have to take her to her .
We'll take them to the winding stairs .
Yes , to the stairs .
And then?
Up , up , up the stairs until we get to the tunnel!
And when they go in there , they don't come out again .
She's always hungry .
She always needs food .
She's got to eat .
She'll only get dirty orcs .
And they don't taste delicious , what , honey?
No . No .
Not at all delicious , my dear .
She wants sweeter meat .
Hobbit meat .
And if she throws away the bones and the remaining clothes , then we find him .
And then it's mine!
Us .
Yes , we meant each other .
Gollum ...
Gollum!
The treasure will be ours once the Hobbitse are dead!
You sneaky little ...
No! No!
No! No!
Sir!
No , Sam , leave him alone!
I heard it from his own mouth .
He wants to kill us!
Sméagol wouldn't do anything to a fly .
The disgusting , fat Hobbit does not like Sméagol . That's why he invents mean lies .
You wretched little Made!
I'll hit your head!
Sam!
You're the liar!
If you chase him away , we're lost!
I don't care!
I can't wait for him to kill us , Mr . Frodo!
- I can't send him away!
- You don't understand , do you?
He's a villain!
We can't do this alone , Sam .
Not without a guide .
I need you by my side .
I am by your side , Mr . Frodo .
I know , Sam .
I know .
Trust me .
Come on , Sméagol .
The stars are veiled .
Something's moving in the east .
A sleepless malice .
The enemy's eye is approaching .
What are you doing?
Pippin!
Pippin!
Pippin!
- Are you crazy?
- I just want to take a look at it .
One last time .
Put it back!
Pippin!
No! No!
Pippin!
He's here .
I see you!
Pippin!
Help!
Gandalf!
Help him!
Pippin!
Naughty Tuk!
Look at me!
Gandalf . Forgive me .
Look at me!
What did you see?
A tree ...
A white tree in a stone yard .
He was dead .
The city was burning .
Minas Tirith .
Did you see that?
I've ...
I've seen him .
I could hear his voice in my head .
What did you tell him?
Speak!
He asked for my name .
I haven't answered .
He hurt me .
What did you tell him about Frodo and the ring?
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes .
A fool , but an honest fool he remains .
He didn't tell Sauron about Frodo and the ring .
We have had strange luck .
Pippin was able to gain an insight into our enemy's plans in the Palantír .
Sauron is planning an attack on the city of Minas Tirith .
His defeat at Helms Klamm showed our enemy one thing:
That Elendil's legacy has emerged and that people are not so weak .
They still have the courage and possibly the strength to challenge him .
Sauron fears this .
That the peoples of Middle-earth unite will not risk it .
Rather he razed Minas Tirith to the ground as the return of a king to the throne of men .
When the beacons of Gondors are lit , Rohan must be ready for war .
Tell me , why should we hurry to help those who have failed us their help?
What do we owe Gondor?
- I'm going .
- You must be warned!
- They will .
You have to take another way to Minas Tirith .
Follow the river and look for the black ships .
You must be aware of one thing:
Something is now going on that cannot be undone .
I ride to Minas Tirith , but not alone .
Of all the nasal hobbits , Peregrin Tuk , you are the worst!
Faster!
Where are we going?
Why did you look?
Why do you always have to look at everything?
- I don't know .
I couldn't help it .
- You can never do that .
I'm sorry , all right?
I'm not doing it again .
Haven't you figured it out yet?
The enemy believes you have the ring .
He'll come looking for you , Pip .
They have to get you out of here .
But you're coming with me , aren't you?
Merry?
Come on!
How far is Minas Tirith?
A three-day ride as the Nazgûl flies .
Let's hope we don't have any of those on our heels .
Here .
A little something for on the go .
The rest of the long-leaf!
I know you don't have one anymore .
You smoke too much , Pip .
But I'll see you soon , won't I?
Or?
I don't know .
I don't know what's going to happen .
Merry!
Run , Shadow Fur . Show us what rush means!
Merry!
Merry!
Guided them in the safest way .
A ship is anchored in the grey waters .
It is waiting to carry them across the sea , the last journey Arwen Undómiels .
There is nothing here for you . Only death .
Mrs . Arwen , we can't stay .
Mistress!
- Tell me what you saw .
- Arwen . You have the gift of foresight .
What did you see?
I've looked into your future and seen death .
There is also life there .
You saw a child there .
You saw my son!
This future is already dwindling .
But she's not lost .
Nothing is certain .
Some things are certain .
If I leave him now , I will regret it forever .
It's time .
From ashes fire is struck , from shadows light emerges .
Salvation becomes bristled sword
and king who lost the crown .
Forge the sword anew ...
Your hands are cool .
The lifeblood of the Eldar leaves you .
This was my decision .
Ada , whether you want it or not , there will be no ship that can take me away .
We have just entered the kingdom of Gondor .
Minas Tirith .
City of Kings .
Get out of the way!
That's the tree!
Gandalf!
Gandalf! Yes , the White Tree of Gondor .
The King's Tree .
But Lord Denethor is not the king .
He's just Truchsess , guardian of the throne .
Now listen to me:
Mr . Denethor is Boromir's father .
To convey to him the news of his son's death would be most unwise .
And don't mention Frodo or the ring .
And you don't say anything about Aragorn either .
It's best not to open your mouth , Peregrin Tuk .
Salvation , Denethor , Ecthelion's son , Lord and Truchsess of Gondor .
I come with a message in this dark hour and with advice .
Maybe yours is coming to explain .
Maybe your come to explain why my son is dead .
Boromir fell to save us , my cousin and me .
- When he defended us against enemies .
- Pippin!
What I can do in services , I offer you to bear this debt .
Get up!
My Lord , the time to mourn Boromir , there will be , but she is not now .
War draws up .
The enemy is standing at your doorstep .
As a Truchsess , you are entrusted with the defense of this city .
Where are Gondor's forces?
You still have friends .
You're not alone in this fight .
Notify Théoden von Rohan .
Ignite the beacon!
You think you're wise , Mithrandir .
Nevertheless , you have no wisdom with all your acumen .
Did you think that the eyes of the White Tower were blind?
I've seen more than you know .
With your left hand you want to use me as a shield against Mordor .
And with the right you seek to displace me .
I know who rides with Théodes von Rohan .
Oh , yes .
I've heard of that Aragorn , Arathorn's son .
I tell you: To such a forest runner from the north I do not bow , the last from a ragged house , for a long time deprived of the rule!
You are not authorized to refuse the king's return , Truchsess!
The rule of Gondor is mine!
Come on!
This is probably just a ceremonial position .
They hardly expect me to fight .
Or is it?
You are now in the service of deception .
You will do what you are told to do ,
Peregrin Tuk , Guardian of the Veste .
It's so quiet .
That's the deep breath before the jump .
I don't want to stand in any battle . But waiting for a who can't escape is even worse .
Is there any hope at all , Gandalf? For Frodo and Sam?
There was never much hope .
Only a fool could hope .
Our enemy is ready .
All his powers are gathered .
Not only orcs , but also people ,
Armies of Haradrim from the south ,
Mercenaries from the coast , they will all follow Mordor's call .
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it .
Here the hammer blow will fall down the most violently .
If the river is taken , if the occupation falls in Osgiliath , then this city is no longer to be defended .
But we have the White Wizard .
This must be good for something .
Gandalf?
Still Sauron has not revealed his most deadly servant , to those who will lead Mordor's forces in war .
Those who say no living man can kill him .
The Witch King of Angmar .
You've met him before .
He wounded Frodo at the top of the weather .
He is the prince of the Nazgûl . The ruler of the Nine .
Minas Morgul is his seat .
The Dead City .
Very bad place .
Full of enemies .
Quickly .
Quick!
You'll see us otherwise!
Come on!
Look , we found him .
The way to Mordor .
The secret staircase .
Climb!
No , Mr . Frodo!
Not that way!
- What's it doing?
- They're calling me .
Hide!
I can feel his blade .
This is now the hour of the great battle of our time .
Come on , Hobbits .
We have to climb!
The chessboard is set up .
The figures are in motion .
Peregrin Tuk , my boy , there is something to do .
Once again , a foreigner can prove its high value .
You can't disappoint me .
Quiet .
To the river!
Quick!
Go on , go on!
Faster!
Draw swords!
Amon Dîn .
The beacon!
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit!
Hope shimmers on .
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are burning!
Gondor asks for help!
And Rohan will follow!
Let the Rohirrim go to the army!
Gather the army in Dunharg .
As many men as can be found .
You have 2 days .
On the third we ride to Gondor and to the war!
Gamling!
Eils through the Riddermark .
Call all qualified men to Dunharg .
- Are you riding with us?
- Just to the camp .
It is custom that the women at the court say goodbye to the men .
The men have found their master of the army .
They will follow you into battle , even to death .
You gave us hope .
In front of the walls of Minas Tirith should decide the fate of our age .
Now the hour has come!
Horsemen of Rohan , oaths you have sworn!
Now fulfill them all!
For Lord and Land!
Faramir!
We can't stand them .
The city is lost .
Give up the positions .
We ride to Minas Tirith .
Nazgûl .
Give up the position!
Fall back!
Retreat to Minas Tirith!
Fall back!
Fall back!
The era of people is over .
The time of the orcs has come .
The White Horseman!
Pull!
Mithrandir!
They broke our defense .
They took over the bridge and the west bank .
Ork associations put on the river over .
As Mr . Denethor prophesied!
- For a long time , he foresaw this downfall .
- And yet he remained idle!
Faramir?
This is not the first halfling who crosses your path .
No . No .
You saw Frodo and Sam?
When?
In Ithilien .
It's not been two days .
Gandalf , they take the road to the Morgul Valley .
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol .
What does that mean?
What have you got?
Faramir , tell me everything .
Be careful , sir!
Here you fall very deep .
Very dangerous is the stairs .
Come on , Lord .
Come to Sméagol .
Mr Frodo!
Get out of there!
Don't touch him!
Why does he hate poor Sméagol?
What has Sméagol ever done to him?
Sir?
The Lord carries a heavy burden .
Sméagol white .
Heavy , heavy burden .
Fat can't know .
Sméagol takes care of the Lord .
He wants it .
He needs him!
Sméagol sees it in his eyes .
Very soon he will ask you about it .
Just wait .
The fat will want to take it away from you .
Sends all troops .
Don't let the storm end until the city is conquered .
Kill them all!
What about the sorcerer?
I'll crush him .
- Where are Théoden's riders?
- Will Rohan's army come?
Mithrandir?
Courage is the best defense you have now .
Here I vow feud and service to Gondor in peace or war , in life or death ,
from ... this hour from now on until my Lord releases me or death takes me .
And I will neither forget nor fail to repay what is given:
Leaning with love ,
Braveness with honor ,
Breach of oath with punishment .
We should not reveal the external defense facilities so lightly that your brother has kept for so long .
What do you want me to do?
I don't want to give up the river in Pelennor without a fight .
Osgiliath must be reclaimed .
Osgiliath was overrun .
A lot has to be dared in the war .
Is there a commander here who still has the courage to fulfill his master's wish?
You wish our places were switched . That I would be dead and Boromir alive .
Yes , that's what I want!
Since you are deprived of Boromirs , I will do what I can in his place .
If I should return , think better of me , Father .
That depends on the way you return .
What are you doing?
Are you snooping again?
Sniffing?
Fat Hobbit is always so polite .
Since Sméagol shows you secret ways , which nobody else finds , and they say sniffing .
Sniffing?
Beautiful friends are those .
Oh , yeah , honey .
It's all right!
You just woke me up .
What have you been up to?
Sniffed .
Good .
Whatever you want .
I'm sorry I have to wake you up .
We have to keep going .
- It's still dark .
- It's always dark here .
It's gone!
The Elvesbread!
What?
That was all we had left .
He stole it!
Certainly!
Sméagol?
No , not poor Sméagol .
Sméagol hates garty elve bread .
Poor liar!
What did you do with it?
He doesn't eat it .
- He couldn't have stolen it .
What's that?
crumbs on his jacket .
He stole's!
He stole's .
I've been watching him .
He always stuffs himself full when the Lord does not look .
That's a dirty lie!
You lousy loupe!
Sam!
Stop it!
I'll kill him!
No! No!
I'm sorry .
I didn't want to let it come that far .
But I was so ... so angry .
Come on , get some rest .
- I'm fine .
- No , you're exhausted .
That's because of that Gollum .
It's in this place .
That's because of this thing around your neck!
I could help a little .
I could wear it for a while ...
... wear for a while .
Share the load ... the load ... the load .
Get out of here!
I just want to help .
See?
He wants it for himself .
Shut up , you!
Get out of here!
No , Sam , you have to go .
I'm sorry , Sam .
But he's lying .
He's trying to incite you against me .
You're no longer helping me .
You don't mean that .
Go home .
Faramir!
Faramir!
Your father's mind has turned into madness .
Don't risk your life so rashly!
How am I supposed to show my loyalty , if not so?
Your father loves you , Faramir .
Before the end comes , he will remember it .
Can you sing , Mr . Hobbit?
Well , yes .
Good enough for my own people at least .
But we don't have songs for big halls and bad times .
Why should your songs be inappropriate for my halls?
Come on , sing me a song .
At home fades , the world moves close .
With many paths it lies there .
And lures through shadows , deception and night .
Until finally star after star awakens :
Cloud , Twilight , Fog Dust .
Without favor , without ...
Favor .
March!
March!
Make room for the king!
My lord!
Hail , my lord!
Grimbold , how many?
About 500 men from the Westfold .
We have 300 more from the Fenmark , Théoden King .
- Where are the riders from the Schneeborn?
- They didn't arrive , sir .
6 .000 spears .
Less than half as much as I hoped .
6 ,000 won't be enough to break Mordor's positions .
There will be more .
With every lost hour Gondor's defeat approaches .
We wait until the morning grays , then we have to ride .
The horses are restless and the men are silent .
The shadow of the mountain worries them .
This road there , where does it lead to?
This is the road to Dimholt , to the gate under the mountain .
No one who goes there , ever returns .
This mountain is evil .
Aragorn!
Let's find something to eat .
There .
A true squire Rohans!
I'm ready!
Forgive me .
It is not particularly dangerous .
It's not even hot .
That's not good .
Many orcs will not kill you with dull blade .
Come on!
To the blacksmith!
Leave!
You shouldn't encourage him .
You shouldn't doubt him .
I don't doubt his heart , just the reach of his arm .
Why leave Merry behind?
He has as much reason to ride into battle as you do .
Why can't he fight for those he loves?
And so I choose a mortal life .
I wish I'd seen him one last time .
Sir?
King Théoden awaits you , Lord .
I'm withdrawing .
My Lord Elrond .
I come on behalf of that one I love .
Arwen is dying .
For a long time she will not survive the evil that is now coming up from Mordor .
The light of the evening star fades .
As Sauron's power increases , so is her power diminishing .
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the ring .
The shadow is above us , Aragorn .
The end has come .
It will not be our end , but his .
You ride into war , but not into victory .
Sauron's forces march to Minas Tirith , this you know .
But he's sending out another war force that's going to attack the river .
A fleet of corsair ships sails from the south .
In 2 days they will be in town .
You have a superiority against yourself , Aragorn .
You need more men .
There is no .
There are those who live in the mountains .
Murderer . Traitor .
You want to call them to fight?
They don't believe in anything .
Don't follow anyone .
They will follow the King of Gondor!
Andúril , the flame of the West , forged from the pieces of Narsil .
Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Mildril .
The blade that was broken will return to Minas Tirith .
Whoever can lead such a powerful sword can also set up a force that is more deadly than any on this earth .
Leave the forest runner behind you .
Make yourself your destiny .
Hit the road to Dimholt .
I give people hope .
I don't keep hope for myself .
Why are you doing this?
In the East war is waged .
You must not leave on the eve of the battle .
You must not abandon the men .
Éowyn ...
We need you here .
Why did you come?
Don't you know that?
It's just a shadow and a thought you love .
I can't give you what you're looking for .
Where are you going?
This time you have to stay behind , Gimli .
Have you never heard of the stubbornness of the dwarfs?
Get rid of it .
We're coming with you , boy .
What happened?
Where is he going?
I don't understand .
Mr . Aragorn!
Why does he leave on the eve of the battle?
He goes because there is no hope anymore .
He's leaving because he has to .
Too few have come .
We can't defeat Mordor's forces .
No , we can't .
Nevertheless , we will face them in battle .
I've left instructions .
You shall rule over the people instead of mine .
Take my seat in the Golden Hall .
Long may you defend Edoras when the battle is lost .
What other duty do you wish to impose on me , Lord?
Duty?
No . No .
I just want you to smile again and not grieve for those whose time has come .
You will experience brighter days again . And no more despair .
What kind of army is in such a place?
One that's cursed .
Once the people of the mountains swore an oath to the last king of Gondor to help him in the event of battle .
But when the time came and Gondor was in extreme need , they fled and hid in dark places in the mountains .
So cursed Isildur her to never find rest until her oath was fulfilled .
Even the warmth of my blood seems to have stolen away .
The path is blocked .
It was created by those who are dead .
And the dead keep him .
The path is blocked .
Brego!
I'm not afraid of death .
That's outrageous!
An elb goes under the ground and a dwarf doesn't dare?
That would be in my ears forever .
We ride with little load and fast .
It's a long way .
Man and animal must still be able to fight when they have covered him .
Little Hobbits do not belong in the war , Mr . Meriadoc .
All my friends went to battle .
I'd be ashamed to stay behind .
It's a three-day ride to Minas Tirith .
You would only be a burden to my riders .
I want to fight!
That's my last word .
Ride with me .
Mistress!
Form up!
Move out!
Ride!
Ride to Gondor now!
Who enters my kingdom?
One who demands your feud .
The dead do not tolerate that the living enter here .
You will tolerate me .
The path is blocked .
It was created by those who are dead .
And the dead keep him .
The path is blocked .
Now you have to die .
I urge you to fulfill your oath!
No one but the King of Gondor can give me orders .
This blade was broken .
It was reforged!
Fight for us and get your honor back .
What do you say?
What do you say?
You're wasting your time , Aragorn .
They had no honor in life and even now have no honor in death .
I'm Isildur's heir .
Fight for me , then I see your oath as fulfilled .
What do you say?
Open the gate!
Quick!
Quick!
Hurry up!
Faramir!
Don't say he fell!
They were in the minority .
No one survived .
Fear!
The whole city stinks of it .
Let's ease their punishment .
Send the prisoners back .
Catapults!
My sons have fallen .
My sex dies out .
He's alive!
The House of Truchesses has failed .
He needs medicine , Lord .
I'm the last of my sex .
Sir!
Rohan has abandoned us .
Théoden betrayed me .
Leave your posts!
Run!
Flee for your lives!
Get ready to fight!
Quick , men!
To the wall!
Defend the wall!
Back to your posts!
Send these disgusting beasts into the abyss!
Don't move!
We need more rupture!
Watch out!
In the lower ring!
Quick!
Hurry up , men!
Repel them!
Don't be overmanned by fear!
Stay on your post! Fight!
On the towers!
Aim for the trolls!
Kill the trolls!
Kill them!
Repel them!
Peregrin Tuk!
Go back to the Veste!
You called us to fight!
This is not a place for a Hobbit .
Guards of the Veste are you indeed .
Now run back up!
Quick!
In there .
What is this place?
The Lord must enter the tunnel .
I don't think I want that anymore .
This is the only way .
Go inside or go back .
I can't go back .
- What's that smell?
- Orcsendreck .
Orcs come here sometimes .
Quick!
This way!
Sméagol?
Over here!
That's very sticky!
What's that?
You'll see in a minute .
Oh , yes .
You'll see in a minute .
Sméagol?
Sméagol?
Sméagol!
Sam .
And to you , Frodo Beutlin , I give the light to Eärendil , our beloved star .
May it be a light to you in dark places when other lights extinguish .
Garst's fly small , who hears your scream 'n?
Your life is in pieces , soon you will be ... eaten!
Got away , my dear?
No , not this time .
Not this time!
We weren't!
Sméagol would do nothing to the Lord .
We promised .
He must believe us!
The treasure was's .
The treasure has forced us to .
I have to destroy him , Sméagol .
I have to destroy him for the sake of both of us!
No! No!
I'm so sorry , Sam .
I'm so sorry .
This task has been assigned to you , Frodo from the Auenland .
If you can't find a way , no one will find it .
Reinforce the gate!
Quick!
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir .
No long , dull death sleep , embalmed .
Let us burn like the pagan kings of the ancient forefathers .
Brings wood and oil!
Quiet!
Quiet!
You're soldiers of Gondor .
Whatever may come through this gate , you hold your position!
Salve!
Fire!
Let him go , Scheusal!
You won't touch him again!
Come on , let's finish it!
Move!
Mr Frodo!
No . No .
Frodo .
Mr Frodo .
Wake up .
Don't leave me here alone .
Don't go where I can't follow you .
Wake up .
You're not sleeping .
You're dead .
What's that?
The old Kankra probably took a little fun .
- He's got another one off , huh?
- No , I'm not .
This guy's not dead .
Not dead?
A little peeker from her and he's going to be limp like a deburred fish .
Then she has her fun with him .
That's how she likes to eat .
Fresh blood .
Into the tower with him!
Samweis , you fool!
In a few hours , the bastard wakes up again .
And then he wishes he was never born .
The house of his soul collapses .
He's on fire .
He's already on fire .
He's not dead .
He's not dead!
No! No!
No! No!
No! No!
He's not dead!
Farewell , Peregrin , Paladin's son .
I'm releasing you from my service .
Go now and die in the way that seems to you the best .
Pour oil on the wood!
Go on!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
They have invaded the city .
Fall back behind the 2nd ring!
Take the women and children out!
Fall back!
Go on!
Move into the city .
Kill everyone on your way .
Take her down!
Fight!
Fight to the last man!
Fight for your lives!
Courage , Merry .
Courage for our friends .
Make rows , you maggots!
Makes rows!
Spears forward .
Archers behind it .
Éomer , lead your eored to the left flank .
Flank ready .
Gamling , follow the king's banner in the middle .
Grimbold , lead your flock behind the wall to the right .
Forward! And fear no darkness .
On! On , your rider Théodens!
Spear will be shattered! Shield split!
Sword Day! Blood Day! Before the sun rises!
No matter what happens , stay with me .
I'll take care of you .
Now ride!
Now ride!
Ride to destruction and the end of the world!
Death!
Death!
Death!
Death!
To , Eorlingas!
Fire!
Storm!
Fire free!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Denethor has lost his mind!
He wants to burn Faramir alive!
Jump up!
Quick!
Put our meat on fire now .
Hold on to this madness!
No! No!
You won't take my son from me .
Faramir .
Thus goes Denethor , Ecthelion's son ,.
Drive them to the river!
Make sure that the city is secured!
Make a line of attack!
Make a line of attack!
Blast to attack!
Take her at the top!
Storm!
Take the reins!
To the left!
Left!
Aim for the heads!
Take him down!
Merry!
I didn't think it would end this way .
Ends?
No , here the journey does not end .
Death is just another way , one we all have to go .
The grey rain curtain of this world is withdrawn and everything turns into silver glass .
And then you see it .
What , Gandalf?
What do I see?
White beaches .
And behind it a distant green land under a rapidly rising sun .
Well , then it's not that bad .
No . No .
No , that's not it .
Gather around me!
To me!
Eat you full of his meat!
I'll kill you if you touch him!
Don't come between the Nazgûl and his prey!
As always too late , pirate pack .
There is knife work to do here .
Come on , you sea rats!
Get off your ships .
There's enough for both of us .
May the best dwarf win .
You fool .
No man can kill me .
Die now .
I'm not a man .
15!
16!
17!
- 29!
- Legolas!
33! 34!
It still counts only as one!
All right!
Come here!
I know your face . Éowyn .
My eyes are getting dark .
No . No .
No . No .
I will save you .
You've already done that .
Éowyn , my body is crushed .
You have to let me go .
I go to my fathers , in whose exhilarating company I do not need to be ashamed now .
Éowyn .
Release us!
I'd rather not .
You can need the guys even if they're dead .
You gave us your word .
I consider your oath fulfilled .
Go on .
Take it easy .
Merry .
Merry , I'm's .
I'm pippin!
I knew you'd find me .
Yes .
Are you going to leave me now?
No , Merry .
I'll take care of you .
Get your hands off me!
The shiny shirt is mine .
This comes to the Great Eye , along with everything else .
I won't let stinky Morgul rats command me!
If you touch it , I'll put that blade in your mouth!
The scumbag tried to stab me!
Kill him!
That's for Frodo!
And for the Auenland .
And this is for my old ohm!
Stop squeaking , you shithead rat .
You'll bleed like a stabbed pig!
- Not if I cut you off first .
- Sam!
Oh , Sam , I'm so sorry .
I'm so sorry about everything .
- Let's get you out of here .
- Too late .
It's over .
They took him .
Sam , they took the ring!
I beg your pardon , but you didn't .
I thought I lost you .
So I took it .
Just to keep him .
Give it to me!
Give me the ring , Sam .
Sam!
Give me the ring .
Don't you understand?
The ring is my burden .
He'll destroy you , Sam .
Come on , Mr . Frodo .
Let's find you some clothes .
You can't walk through Mordor with nothing but your skin .
We did it , Mr . Frodo .
We've reached Mordor .
There are so many of them .
Unseen we never get through .
It's him . The eye .
We have to go through this , Mr . Frodo .
I can't help it .
Come on .
Let's go down the mountain for the start .
I can no longer see Frodo in the distance .
The darkness is increasing .
If Sauron had the ring , we would know .
It's just a matter of time .
He has suffered a defeat , yes , but behind the walls Mordor strengthens our enemy anew .
Let him stay there .
You're rotting!
Why would we care?
Because 10 ,000 orcs now stand between Frodo and the Fate Mountain .
I sent him to death .
No . No .
There's still hope for Frodo .
He needs time and a safe way across the plain of Gorgoroth .
We can help him with that . How?
We need to lure Sauron's force out to expose his country .
Then we bring up all our strength and march to the Black Gate .
We can't win with weapons .
Not for us .
But we can support Frodo , if Sauron's eye remains on us , if we make sure that he is blind to everything else that moves .
A distraction .
Sauron will see a trap .
He won't let himself be baited .
Death as certainty . Low chance of success . What are we waiting for?
To the gates , you lame sacks!
Move!
To the gates!
Look , the orcs , they're pulling off!
See , Mr . Frodo? Finally a little luck .
Take mine .
A few drops are still in there .
Now there's nothing left for the way back .
I do not believe that there will be a way back , Mr Frodo .
Frodo , down!
Hide!
Frodo!
Where are they?
The Lord of the Black Land should step out!
He should receive his just punishment!
Back up!
It's gone , Mr . Frodo .
The light has moved to the north .
Something has distracted his gaze .
Hold your position!
Sons of Gondor and Rohans , my brothers!
In your eyes I see the same fear that would make me despair .
The day may come , as the courage of men dwindles , as we abandon our companions and break bonds of friendship .
But this day is not today .
The hour of wolves is's and shattered shields , as the age of men is dying!
But this day is not today .
Today we fight!
With all that is dear to you on this good earth , I tell you: Stand still , people of the West!
Never would I have thought that I would die side by side with an Elbe fighting .
And side by side with a friend?
Yes .
I could .
Do you remember the Auenland , Mr . Frodo?
There's spring soon .
Then the fruit trees bloom .
And the birds build their nests in the hazelnut thicket .
And they will sow the summer barley on the lower fields and eat the first strawberries with cream .
Remember the taste of strawberries?
No , Sam , I have no memory of the taste of food , of the sound of water or of how grass feels .
I'm naked in the dark .
There is nothing , no veil between me and the fire wheel .
I can see him . With awake eyes!
Then let's finally get rid of him . Once and for all!
Come on , Mr . Frodo .
I can't wear it for you , but I can carry you!
Come on!
Aragorn .
Elessar!
For Frodo .
There , Mr . Frodo .
An entrance .
We're almost there .
Smart hobbits , so high to climb!
Frodo!
Eagle!
The eagles are coming!
Frodo!
Here I am , Sam .
Destroy him!
Come on , now!
Throw him in the fire!
What are you waiting for?
Just let him go!
The ring is mine!
No . No .
No . No .
No! No!
Yes!
Yes!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
Give me your hand .
Take my hand!
No! No!
Don't let go .
Don't let go .
Grab it!
Frodo!
Frodo!
He's gone .
It's done .
Yes , Mr . Frodo .
Now it's over .
I can see the Auenland .
The Brandyw influence .
Bagging .
Gandalf's fireworks .
The lights on the festival tree .
Rosie Hüttinger dancing .
She wore ribbons in her hair .
If I'd ever married one , she would've been .
She would've been!
I'm glad to be with you , Samweis Gamjie , here at the end of all things .
Gandalf?
Frodo!
Gimli!
Now come the days of the king .
May they be blessed .
This day does not belong to a single man , but to all of us .
Let us rebuild this world together so that we may share it in times of peace .
My friends , you bow to no one .
And so a fourth age began in Middle-earth .
The community of the ring , although eternally united in friendship and love , dissolved .
To the day 13 months after Gandalf had sent us on the long journey , offered us a familiar sight .
We were at home!
Attention , pumpkin!
Rosie , Rosie!
Good night , boys .
How do you link to a previous life?
How do you go on when you start to understand deep in your heart that there is no going back?
Some things can't heal time , some pain sitting too deep and clinging to you .
Mr Frodo?
What is it?
4 years have passed since the day at the top of the weather , Sam .
It's never healed properly .
The story of a Hobbit by Bilbo Beutlin and The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Beutlin
You're done .
Not quite .
There is still room for a little more .
Bilbo once told me that his role in this story ends , that we all have to appear in it and disappear again .
Bilbo's story was now over .
For him there would be no more trips , except for one .
Tell me again , my boy . Where are we going?
To the port , Bilbo .
The Elves grant you a special honor: A place on the last ship that leaves Middle Earth .
Frodo? Could I see my old ring again?
The one I gave you?
I'm sorry , Uncle .
I'm afraid I've lost him .
Too bad .
I would have liked to have held him in my hand one last time .
This is a sight I haven't had in my life yet .
The power of the 3 rings has an end .
The time has come for man's rule .
The sea is calling us home .
I think I'm well prepared for another adventure .
Farewell , my brave hobbits .
My work is done .
Here now , on the shores of the sea , comes the end of our community .
I don't want to say , don't cry , because not all tears are of evil .
It's time , Frodo .
What does he mean?
We went to save the Auenland .
And it has been saved .
But not for me .
You're not serious .
You can't leave!
The last pages are for you , Sam .
My dear Sam!
You can't always be torn apart .
You will have to be whole and whole for many years .
There's still so much you can be happy about , what you can be and do .
Because your role in history goes on , Sam .
Yes . I'm back .
My dear Frodo :
You once asked me if I'd told you all the stories about my adventures .
And although I can claim to have always told you the truth ,
I didn't tell you everything .
I'm old now , Frodo .
I'm not the same Hobbit I used to be .
I think it's time you learned what really happened .
It started a long time ago in a country far in the east . A country as you can no longer find it today around the world .
There was the city
With its well-known markets .
Crops and wine in abundance .
Peaceful and prosperous .
For this city lay at the gates of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:
Erebor .
Mountain fortress of Thror , the king under the mountain , the most powerful of all dwarf princes .
Thror's reign was unchallenged . He never doubted the survival of his house , his ruling line was nevertheless secured by his son and grandson .
Oh , Frodo , Erebor .
Built deep into the mountain , the beauty of this fortress city was legendary .
Their wealth lay in the earth , in precious gemstones , struck out of the rock , and in huge gold veins , which ran like rivers through the stone .
The skills of the dwarfs sought their own . They created objects of greatest beauty from diamonds , emeralds , rubies and sapphires .
Incessantly they stirred deeper in the darkness .
And there they found him .
The heart of the mountain .
The Arkenstein .
Thror called him The King's Jewel .
He saw him as a sign to be the chosen king .
Everyone paid homage to him .
Even the great
Elves King , Thranduil .
As the prosperity of the dwarfs grew , their good will gradually diminished .
No one knows exactly what caused the disintegration .
The Elves say the Dwarves stole their treasure .
The Dwarves say the Elven King has denied them their rightful share .
It's sad , Frodo , how old alliances break , how friendships between peoples can be lost .
And for what?
Melancholy went through the days and mistrust clouded the nights .
Thror's love for gold had become too powerful .
A disease began to grow in it .
A disease of the mind .
And where sickness prospers , evil will follow .
The first thing they heard was a noise like a wild storm roaring from the north .
The pines on the mountain slopes cracked and broke in the hot , dry wind .
Balin , sound alarm .
Call the guard .
Now!
Thorin , what is this?
A dragon .
Dragon!
It was a fire dragon from the north .
Smaug had come .
Death was merciless that day .
The human city meant nothing to Smaug .
He was after another prey .
Because gold awakens a dark , wild desire in dragons .
Ah!
No! No!
Quick , come on .
Erebor was lost .
Because a dragon guards his prey as long as he lives .
Run for your lives!
Ah!
Help us!
Thranduil did not want to expose the life of His Own to the wrath of the dragon .
No help came from the Elves that day . And on no other day ever since .
Deprived of their homeland , the dwarfs of Erebor roamed the wilderness . A once powerful people was powerless and discouraged .
The young dwarf prince took every job in the villages of people that he could find .
But he never forgot the smoke of the mountain in the moonlight , the mountain forest , which torched brightly the night .
For he had seen the fire of the dragon in heaven , and cities that became ashes .
And he has never forgiven and never forgotten .
Far away , at another end of the world , dragons were just a fantasy .
They're flying!
Pieces of wizards at festivals at the solstice .
Not more terrifying than fairy dust .
Bilbo!
And at this point , my dear Frodo , I come into play .
Bilbo!
Don't .
It was the beginning of an unprecedented friendship that lasted my whole life .
But this is not the beginning of my story .
For me , she started ...
Well , she started , as you probably expected .
In a hole in the ground , there lived a Hobbit .
Not in a damp , dirty hole full of worms and fad smell .
No , the hole was a hobbit cave and that means: good food , a warm stovefire
Thank you .
What's that?
This is personal .
Take your curious paws away .
It's not finished yet .
Ready for what?
To be read .
What , all over the world , is this?
Answers to the invitation to the feast .
Oh , my God .
Oh , my God .
Is that today?
Everyone has agreed .
With the exception of the Sackheim-Beutlins . They want you to invite them personally .
So , do you want that , yes?
Only over
- They'd probably be okay with that .
- my body .
They seem to believe that you possess gold in abundance .
A small box that is not overflowing .
And she still smells like Troll .
What , all over the world , are you doing?
I'm making arrangements .
I caught her once when she wanted to take the silver .
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackheim-Beutlin .
She had stuffed all my spoons in her pocket .
Ha!
Terrible woman's room .
Promise me to keep an eye on her when I ...
If I ...
If I ...
If you what?
Oh , nothing .
Nothing .
You know , some are already thinking about you , Uncle .
- What?
- They think you're going to be wondrous .
Wonderful?
Oh , um .
And not easy to handle .
Not easy?
I don't know .
Be so good , and hang that out to the gate .
Do you think he's coming?
Who?
Gandalf .
Oh , yeah .
He won't miss out on ignite his magic bangers .
This will be a real spectacle . You'll see .
All right .
I have to go .
- Where?
To the forest in the east quarter .
I want to surprise him .
Well , off you go .
Otherwise you'll be late .
He doesn't like it when you're late .
Oh no . Not that I've ever been late .
At that time I was always on time .
I was through and through righteous .
And nothing unexpected ever happened .
- Good morning .
What do you mean?
Do you wish me a good morning , or do you mean that it is a nice morning , no matter what I wish?
Or you wanted to say that this morning you find everything beautiful and good?
Or did you want to say that you have to be good or beautiful this morning?
Hmm?
Everything at the same time , I suppose .
Hm .
Can I help you?
This remains to be seen .
I'm preparing an adventure , and I'm looking for someone who's still going along .
An adventure?
I don't think anyone west of Bree has a lot of interest in adventure .
There's nothing but trouble and mischief .
And you're late for dinner .
Ha , ha .
Mmm .
Really?
Hm .
Oh .
Ah .
Good morning .
That I'll get rid of Belladonnna Tuk's son with a good morning , as if I was selling buttons at the door .
Excuse me?
You've changed . And not just for the better ,
Bilbo Beutlin .
Excuse me , do I know you?
Well , you know my name , although you don't know that it belongs to me .
I'm Gandalf .
And Gandalf I am .
Gandalf?
The old Tuk let one burn down at every summer solstice .
Ha .
I had no idea you were still in business .
And , where else should I be?
Well ...
Uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh
Well , I'm glad you still know something about me . And if it's just my fireworks .
Yes .
That would then be decided .
It will do you extremely well and be very amusing for me .
I'll tell the others .
Tell who?
What?
No . No .
No , no , no , no .
Wait .
We have no use for adventure , certainly not here .
Neither today , nor ...
I suggest you try it behind the Bühl or beyond the waters .
Good morning .
Tomorrow!
Here you go .
Have a nice day .
Chum .
Hello , Mr . Bilbo .
Here , you can feel my tubers .
How pretty tight they are .
- Fresh from the west quarter .
- Yes , very impressive , Master Worrywort .
You didn't happen to see a wizard sneak around here?
A big guy?
Long , grey beard?
Spitzer hat?
No , I haven't seen .
Dwalin . At your service .
Hm .
Uh ...
Bilbo Beutlin , to yours .
Do I know you?
No . No .
Where to , kid?
Is it down here?
Is there something down there?
Dinner .
He said , there is food , and plenty of it .
Has ...
Did he say?
Who said?
Hm .
Hm .
Very good is this .
Is there any more?
What?
Oh , yeah , yeah .
Ah .
Here , please , serve you .
Hmm ...
It's just that , I didn't necessarily expect company .
That's probably the door .
Balin . At your service .
Good evening .
Yes .
Yeah , he's good .
Although I think it might rain later .
Am I late?
Too late for what?
Oh!
Ha , ha!
Evening , brother .
With my beard , you've become shorter and wider , since last time .
Broader , not shorter .
And still smart enough , for both of us .
Uh , excuse me , excuse me .
I hate to interrupt , but I'm not quite sure if you're in the right house .
Have you eaten yet?
So , actually , I have nothing against visiting . I appreciate visiting , just like any other Hobbit .
But even more I appreciate to know him before he visits me .
- What's that?
- I don't know .
- It's supposed to be cheese .
It's all blue .
Hidden with mold .
It's so , I don't know both of you .
Not at all .
I don't want to be rude , but that had to be said .
- I'm sorry .
Apology accepted .
- Oh .
- Come on , brother , don't be so kinky .
Enjoy it .
- I could eat something if you insist .
- Fili .
- And Kili .
At your service .
You must be Mr . Bagger .
No! No!
You can't come in .
This is the wrong house .
What?
- Has it been canceled?
- We don't know anything about that .
Nothing was canceled at all .
I'm relieved .
Careful with that .
I just ground it .
- Nice house . Very nice here .
Yes .
- Did you build it yourself?
- What?
No , it's been in family ownership for a long time .
This is my mother's check-out box .
Will you please not do that?
Fili , Kili , coming .
Let's get on with it .
Mr Dwalin .
Ha , ha .
Put this in the hallway , or we'll never get everyone in here .
Everybody?
How many more are coming?
Where is he going?
- Oh , no .
This thing is really heavy .
No . No .
No . No .
There's no one at home!
Just go back , and bother someone else .
There are too many dwarfs in my dining room .
If there is any wooden head allowed a joke , then I can only say , it is extremely tasteless .
Gandalf .
Excuse me , this is my chicken .
Um ...
And if you don't ...
And this is my wine .
I must ask you very much!
He says he feels slightly uncomfortable .
Because there's a hatchet in his head?
Is it dead?
No , he's just buzzing his skull .
His legs are still healthy .
Put that back .
Put it back down .
Put it back down .
Not the jam .
Excuse me .
Excuse me .
An idea exaggerated , isn't it?
Do you have a cheese knife?
- Cheese knife?
He eats it all .
Oh , my God .
No . This is Grandpa Mungo's chair .
No , and that too .
Bring him back , please .
- I can't hear what you're saying .
An antique , not to sit .
This is a book , not a coaster .
And please return the card .
- Excuse me , Mr . Gandalf?
- Yes?
May I seduce you to a cup of chamomile tea?
Oh , no thanks , Dori .
I would prefer a glass of red wine .
Careful .
- Oh .
Yes .
Uh , Fili , Kili .
Uh ...
Oin , Gloin .
Dwalin , Balin , Bifur , Bofur , Bombur ,
- Dori , Nori , Ori!
- No , I'm not .
Not my award-winning tomatoes .
No , thank you .
Yes , you're absolutely right , Bifur .
We obviously still need a dwarf .
He's just late .
He wandered north to the meeting of our clan .
He's coming .
Mr Gandalf?
A glass of red wine , as desired .
He has a fruity bouquet .
Oh .
For the good .
I think we should start . Bombur already eats his second lamb club .
Hm .
Never .
Not from a distance .
Shall we bet?
You throw like a girl .
Ah , you clumsy tramp!
Who wants a beer?
Here you go .
I want one , brother .
I said , have another drink .
Drink from , on 3!
1 ,
- Two ...
- Cheers!
I knew there was something in you!
Sorry , this is a lace doily and not a dishcloth .
But there's holes in there .
That's what it's like .
It's laced .
Oh , nothing goes on a good clapping . If you have the right beating .
That the beards are tossing them away , these dwarfs!
My dear Bilbo , what's going on all over the world?
What's going on?
I'm surrounded by dwarfs .
What are they doing here?
You're a very cheerful congregation when you get used to it .
I don't want to get used to her .
Look what my kitchen looks like .
The carpet is full of mud .
The pantry is looted .
Not to mention the bathroom .
They've broken it as good as they did .
I don't understand what they want in my house!
I'm sorry if I interrupt you , but what should I do with my plate?
It's okay , Ori , give it to me .
Carry that back .
Excuse me .
That's my mother's good West Quarter tableware .
That's over 100 years old!
And , will you please let that be?
You make her dull .
Oh , guys , did you hear that?
He said the knives are dull .
Cuts the tablecloth from Damast
Now set fire to the old cork
Throw the glasses firmly against the wall
Doing what Bilbo Beutlin
Hated
Sprinkle the wine on every door
Into the ground the fat stomps
Drinks the carpets well with beer
Throws out the bones
Under the bed
We're crushing with the hatchet
Pots , bowls , porcelain
And then it's still
A little healing
Let's start from the beginning .
Do what Bilbo Beutlin hates
Well , Bilbo?
He's here .
Gandalf .
Didn't you say this place was easy to find?
I'm lost . Twice .
Without the sign at the door I wouldn't have found it at all .
Signs?
There's no sign .
It was just painted a week ago .
There is a sign .
I put it on my own .
Bilbo Beutlin . May I introduce you to the leader of our enterprise?
Thorin Oak Shield .
So , that's the Hobbit .
Say , Mr . Beutlin , are you experienced in battle?
- Please what?
Axe or sword?
What weapon is yours?
I throw a very elegant horse chestnut , if you want to know . But I don't know how that should matter .
I thought so .
More like a merchant than a master thief .
Did everyone come?
- Yes .
Envoys of all 7 kingdoms .
Sounds promising!
And what did the dwarves from the iron mountains say?
Is Dain joining us?
They won't come .
You say this trip is our thing . THORIN: Ours alone .
You're going on a trip?
Bilbo , my dear friend , could we have a little more light?
Far east , behind mountains and rivers , beyond forests and wasteland , lies a single , remote mountain .
The Lonely Mountain .
O Unto hath interpreted the signs , and the signs say that the time is ripe .
One has seen ravens flying back to the mountain , as it was prophesied .
When the birds return from ancient times to Erebor , the rule of the beast will end .
What beast?
Flying fire-spoker .
Teeth like razors and claws like butcher hooks .
With a preference for precious metal .
Yes , I know what a dragon is .
I'm not afraid .
I'm ready .
I let him feel what a dwarf blade is , right in his very best!
That's right , Ori!
Even with an army in the back the task would be difficult enough , but we are only 13 .
Sit down .
And neither 13 of the best nor the wisest .
Hey , are you calling us stupid?
Excuse me , what did he say?
We may not be very many , but we are fighters . FILI: Each of us .
And remember , we have a magician in our ranks .
Gandalf must have killed hundreds of dragons already .
Oh , well , no .
I wouldn't say that ...
How many then?
- What?
How many dragons did you kill?
Come on .
Give us a number .
Excuse me .
Please .
If we have recognized the signs , do you not believe that others also see them?
The rumors are already spreading .
The dragon Smaug was no longer seen for 60 years .
Looking to the east , to the mountain . Evaluating , contemplating , weighing the risk .
The immeasurable wealth of our people may be without protection .
Do we just watch how others get what is rightfully ours?
Or do we seize this opportunity and get the Erebor back?
You forget , the main gate is locked .
There is no way into the mountain .
That , my dear Balin , is not quite true .
How did you get to him?
Your father entrusted it to me .
Thrain .
I should keep him .
He's yours now .
If there is a key , then there is also a door .
These runes describe a secret passage to the Lower Halls .
There is another entrance .
When we find him . Closed dwarf doors are invisible .
The solution is hidden somewhere in this map , just I don't have the ability to find it , but there are others in Middle Earth that can .
The act I imagine is based on secrecy and needs a certain amount of courage .
But if we're careful and smart , I think we can make it .
That's why we need a master thief .
Hm .
And that's a good one .
The best , I want mine .
And , is that you?
Am I what?
He said he's the best .
Hey .
What , me?
No . No .
I'm not a thief .
I've never stolen anything in my life .
Well , I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr . Beutlin .
It is not carved out of thieves' wood .
No . No .
Yes , the wilderness is no place for fine people who know neither to fight , nor to defend themselves .
He'll figure it out . Look at him .
Enough!
When I say that Bilbo Beutlin is a master thief , then he is a master thief .
Hobbits are remarkably light-footed .
Basically they come by almost everyone unseen , if you want .
And while the dragon can easily smell dwarfs , the smell of a hobbit is almost unknown to him . Which brings us a decisive advantage .
I should find the fourteenth member , and I have chosen Mr Beutlin .
There's more in him than you can guess , and a lot more ,
when he himself suspects .
You have to trust me .
All right .
- Let's do it your way .
- No , no .
Give him the contract .
- Here we go .
It's just the usual .
Summary of travel costs , working hours , remuneration , funeral expenses , and so on .
Burial costs?
I can't guarantee his safety .
I see .
Nor will I be responsible for his fate .
Agreed .
Conditions :
Payment on delivery , profit sharing one fourteenth of the total profit .
Hmm .
Seems appropriate .
Signatories shall not be liable for any injury caused by the course , including but not limited to lacerations ,
Elongation ...
- Burn?
Well , he melts the flesh off your bones in no time .
All right , kid?
What?
Yes , go .
Just a little fuzzy .
- Imagine a winged furnace .
Yes , I have to get in the air .
Hm .
No . No .
Oh , very helpful , Bofur .
I'll be right back .
I just want to rest , a moment .
You've been resting for too long .
Tell me , when did lace doily and your mother's porcelain become so important to you?
I remember a Hobbit who always ran in search of elves through the woods .
The long remained outside , only came home in the darkness , covered by mud and twigs , followed by fireflies .
A young Hobbit who would have done nothing rather than explore what lies behind the borders of the Auenland .
The world is not in your books and maps .
She's out there .
I can't just open up in the blue .
I'm a beutlin of bagging .
You're also a Tuk .
Did you know that your great urururonkel
Bull turf Tuk was so big that he could ride on a real horse?
- Yes .
- Yes , he could .
In the Battle of Grünfeld he entered the ranks of the Orcs .
He swung his club with such force that he smacked off the orc king's head , which then flew 100 paces through the air and fell into a rabbit hole .
So the battle was won .
And at the same time invented the golf game .
You just made it up .
All good stories deserve to be embellished .
You yourself will have some to tell when you return .
Can you promise me that I will return?
No . No .
And if you do , you'll be different .
I thought so .
I'm sorry , Gandalf , I don't sign .
You got the wrong Hobbit .
Obviously we have lost our master thief .
It's probably better this way .
Our chances were never good .
And finally , who are we?
Merchants , miners , boiler flicker , toy makers .
Ha , ha .
Not the fabric , from which legends are .
There are also some warriors among us .
Old warriors .
I would prefer every one of these dwarfs to an army from the Iron Mountains .
Because when I called them , they were there .
Loyalty , Honor , a fighter heart .
That's all I can really ask for .
You don't have to do this .
You have a choice .
You have always been honorable to our people .
You gave us a new life in the Blue Mountains .
A life in peace and abundance .
A life that is worth more than all gold in Erebor .
From my grandfather to my father , this came to me .
They dreamed of the day when the Dwarves Erebors reclaimed their homeland .
There is no choice , Balin .
Not for me .
Then we'll stand by you , boy .
We're gonna make it .
About
The Fog Mountains Far
Deep to Caves
Ancient times
There we go .
There's a win
By wind and weather
Distress and suffering
And where crackling
Awoke in the wood
A fire
Of winds
Inflated
To the sky red
The Flame Loans
Mountain forest torched
Bright the night
Hello?
Yes .
Yes .
Mr . Bilbo , what's the rush?
- No time , I'm already late!
- Too late for what?
I'm going on an adventure!
I said's .
Didn't I say?
Coming here was a waste of time .
That's true , though .
Narrical thought to take a halfling .
Whose idea was that anyway?
Wait!
Wait!
Hold on , hold on .
Whoa , whoa .
I signed it .
Here .
Everything seems to be all right .
Welcome , Master Beutlin , to the community of Thorin Eichenschild .
Give him a pony .
No , that won't be necessary .
Thank you .
I'm sure I can keep up well on foot .
Because I've been hiking a lot , you know?
Once even to frog moorstetten .
Aah!
Come on , Nori .
Numbers .
Here you go .
Thank you , my boy .
What's this about?
Oh , they've made bets whether you show up or not .
Most have bet , you wouldn't do it .
What did you think?
Oh ...
My dear friend , I haven't doubted you for a second .
Oh , horse hair .
I don't make it so good .
No , stop , stop , stop .
Stop!
We have to turn around .
- I forgot my handkerchief .
Here .
Take this .
And go on .
You will have to get along without handkerchiefs and lots of other things , Bilbo Beutlin , until we are at the end of our journey .
Your home are the gentle hills and small rivers of the Auenland .
But at home fades .
And the world is getting close .
Hello , my little one .
Such a good girl .
That remains our little secret , Myrtle .
Don't tell me .
Psst , psst .
What was that?
Orcs .
Orcs?
Slashes .
Dozens are out there .
In the Empty Lands - it is teeming with them .
You hit shortly before dawn , when everything sleeps .
Quick and quiet , no one screams .
Only a lot of blood .
Do you think that's funny?
Do you think an orc attack at night is a joke?
We didn't think anything about it .
No , you didn't .
You don't know anything about the world .
Don't blame him , my boy .
Thorin has more reason than most to hate the orcs .
After the dragon had snatched the Lone Mountain , King Thror demanded back the ancient dwarf kingdom of Moria .
But our enemy was already there .
Moria had been taken by Ork-Sharen , led by the most disgusting of their entire people:
Azog , the swindler .
The giant Gundabad Ork had sworn to wipe out Durin's sex .
First , he beheaded the king .
No! No!
Thrain , Thorin's father , drove the grief into madness .
Whether captured or killed , no one knew it .
He disappeared .
We were without leaders .
Defeat and death came upon us .
Yes , and then I saw him .
A young dwarf prince who offered the bleaching ork's forehead .
Alone he faced this terrible adversary .
With shredded armor , nothing but an oak as a shield in hands .
Azog , the swindler , got to feel on that day that the lineage of Durin is not so easy to conquer .
Our troops gathered and pushed the orcs back .
Our enemy was defeated .
But no feast we celebrated , and no songs we sang that night ; because too many dead we had to complain .
Few of us had survived .
At that time I said to myself: I want to follow this one .
I can call this one king .
And the bleach ork?
What happened to him?
He crawled back into the hole from which he had come .
This scum has long since died from his wounds .
Mr Gandalf , could you do something about this flood?
It rains , Master Dwarf , and it will rain on until it has stopped raining .
If you want to change the weather in the world , you have to find another magician .
- Are there any?
What?
Other wizards?
There are 5 of us .
The highest of our Order is Saruman , the White .
And then there are 2 Blue Wizards , whose name I forgot though .
And who's the fifth?
Oh , that's of course Radagast , the Brown .
Is he a great magician , or is he more like you?
I think he is a very great magician . In his way .
He is a gentle soul who prefers the company of animals .
He watches over the huge forest areas that extend far east .
And that's good , because evil will always try to gain a foothold in this world .
Not good .
Not good at all .
Igitt .
Oh , no , Sebaste .
Oh , my goodness .
There . My goodness , go away , he can't breathe at all .
So .
Here .
Here .
I don't understand why it doesn't work .
After all , this is not witchcraft .
Witchcraft .
Oh , but yes .
A dark and powerful spell .
Where on this good earth do these disgusting creatures come from?
The old fortress?
Take me there .
Here we make our night camp .
Fili , Kili , provides the ponies .
And stay with them .
A farmer and his family have lived here .
Oin , Gloin .
Make a fire .
Yes?
That's right .
I think it would be wiser to move on .
We could ride to the Hidden Valley .
I've already told you .
We're not going anywhere near this place .
Why not?
The Elves are helpful .
There we could eat , sleep , get us advice .
I don't need any advice from them .
We have a map that we can't read .
Mr . Elrond could help us .
Help?
A dragon attacked the Erebor .
What help came from the Elves?
Orcs looted Moria , desecrated our sacred halls .
The Elves have only watched inactively .
And you demand that I seek out those who betrayed my grandfather?
They betrayed my father .
You're neither of them .
I didn't give you a card and keys to hold onto the past .
I didn't know they were yours .
Are you all right?
Gandalf , where are you going?
I'm looking for the company of the only one who's still here with a clear mind .
And who's that?
I , Mr . Beutlin .
That was enough dwarves for a day .
Come on , Bombur , we're hungry .
Is he coming back?
He's been gone a long time .
- Who?
- Gandalf .
He's a magician .
He does what he wants .
Here , do me a favor , and bring this to the boys .
That's enough .
You've had enough .
The stew is not even bad .
I've already eaten worse .
Yes , that what Dori always cooks .
Ha , ha , ha .
To laugh at .
What's going on?
- We should take care of the ponies .
- Only we came across a small problem .
We had 16 .
Now it's 14 .
Margerite and Bungo are missing .
So , that's not good .
Ha , ha .
And that's not good at all .
Shouldn't we say that to Thorin?
Uh , no .
Let's not burden him with that .
As our vouchsafed master thief , you might as well investigate the matter .
So , uh ...
- Something big ripped these trees out .
- We thought so , too .
Something very big and potentially dangerous .
Hey .
There's a light .
This way .
Stay down .
What is it?
Trolls .
Oh .
He has myrtle and minzi .
They'll eat them .
We have to do something .
Yeah , do something .
Mountain trolls are slow and stupid , and you are so small , they never see you .
You'll be fine .
We're right behind you .
If there's trouble , make two times Schuhu like a veil owl , and once like a snow owl .
Twice like a snow owl and once like a ...
Is this really such a good idea?
Yesterday Hammel , today Hammel , and damn me , if's tomorrow does not already give Hammel again .
Stop squatting .
They're not mutton .
These are fresh owls .
Oh!
I don't like horse .
I've never liked it .
- It's not enough fat .
Still better than tougher , old farmer .
He was just skin and bones .
I still have between my teeth .
Oh , wonderful . That swims even up .
Bring in another spice .
Ah .
Where that comes from , there's more .
- You're gonna keep it nice!
Oh , my God!
Sit down!
I hope you take out the gags properly .
I don't like those stinky parts .
- Oh , my God!
- I said sit down .
I'm hungry!
Is there still horse or what?
Shut up .
You eat what I propose to you .
Why is he the cook?
It's all the same .
Everything tastes like chicken .
Except chicken .
It tastes like fish!
I'm just saying . A little more gratitude would be nice .
Thank you very much , Bert .
Delicious stew , Bert .
- Is that so hard?
- Psst .
Psst , psst .
Psst .
There's still squirrel spice missing .
Hey , this is my cup .
Excuse me .
Oh , my God!
Oh , that's delicious , I'd say .
Fressluke on . Try it .
Yummy , huh?
That's why I'm the cook .
Oh , my stomach may growl .
I've got something to eat .
- Meat , I need meat .
Ah!
Ah!
Snot and heron!
Bert .
Bert!
Look what's flooded me from the tine .
It has arms and legs and everything .
What's that?
- I don't know .
But it's disgusting how it's babbled .
What are you?
An oversized squirrel?
I'm a master ...
Uh , Hobbit .
A Master Hobbit?
Can you roast it?
We can try's yes .
He's just making a bite .
There is no longer , without skin and bones .
Maybe there are more master hobbits nearby . Then we could
Make pie .
- Catch him!
He's too fast .
Come here , you little ...
I got you .
Have more of you been hiding here ,
- where you have nothing to do with it?
- No , I'm not .
He's lying .
- No , I'm not!
- Let's hold his toes over the fire .
I want him to muddle!
Put him down!
How was that?
I said , put him down .
Get the bags .
Put them in the sacks .
Ow!
Quick , get up!
- Bilbo!
- Don't!
Throw the weapons away or we'll tear him apart .
Oh , again!
Hot , hot , hot . Hot!
- We don't need to cook them .
We'll sit on them and crush them to sülze .
You should pat her soft and grill her , and sprinkle a pinch of sage over it .
Is that really necessary?
That sounds really delicious .
I can't stand it .
Eat someone as big as you .
Forget the spices .
We don't have forever .
It will soon day . Let's hurry .
Because I don't want to become a stone .
Wait!
You're making a terrible mistake right now .
You can't talk to them .
- It's a simple nut!
Single-folded brush?
And then what are we?
I meant , as far as the spices are concerned .
Yes? What about the spices?
Did you ever smell them?
You already need something stronger than sage , if they are to come on the plate .
What do you know about the cooking of dwarfs?
Shut up .
Let the Kleisterdings Master Hobbit speak out .
The secret to the dwarf cooking is that ...
Yes?
Tell us the secret .
The secret is to skin them first .
- So , uh ...
Yeah , I do .
Are you crazy?
Tom , get my sharp knife .
I'll take your skin off , you lousy traitor!
I won't forget that .
I won't forget that .
It's all just stupid chatter .
I've already eaten many with skin on it .
I say , we suppress them as they are .
He's right .
A bite of raw dwarf can never hurt .
Fresh and crisp .
Oh , not that one .
It's contaminated .
What?
What's this?
Yes , he has worms in his intestines .
Igitt!
Ah!
They're all contaminated together .
They are completely wormed , up to the top .
Disgusting business .
I wouldn't risk it , honestly .
Worms?
Did he say worms?
We don't have worms .
You have worms yourself!
What the fuck , kid?
I have worms as thick as my arm .
My worms are the absolute biggest .
I have huge worms .
Yes , I'm wormed .
I'm also wormed .
Yes , contaminated through and through .
Yes , and what should we do now?
Let everyone go again?
- Well ...
Do you think I don't know what you're up to?
The little ferret thinks we're fools .
Ferrets?
Fools?
The day shall meet you .
Who's that?
I don't know .
Can we eat that too?
Take your foot out of my cross .
Ah .
Where were you , by the way?
Take a look ahead .
What brought you back?
The look to the back .
That was unpleasant .
After all , everyone has remained safe .
Your master thief deserves no thanks .
He had enough grips to gain time .
None of you thought of it .
They must have come from the Ettenöden .
Since when do Bergtrolle venture so far to the south?
Oh .
They haven't done that in years .
A darker power ruled over this country at that time .
In daylight they must not be outside .
That means , nearby there is a cave .
Oh , what's this smell?
It's a Troll-Hort .
Watch what you're touching .
Wouldn't it be a pity to leave all this lying around here?
- Then anyone could take it with them .
- I think so , too .
- Nori ,
Yes?
Get a shovel .
These swords did not forge a troll .
And neither is a blacksmith of men .
They were made in Gondolin . From the High Elves of the First Age .
A better blade can't be desired .
Quick , this too .
That's it .
And now pour .
So , we'll pay off later .
Let's get out of this disgusting hole .
Come . We should go .
Bofur , Gloin , Nori .
Bilbo .
Yes?
Here .
It fits your size .
I can't do that .
Elves have forged this blade , which means it glows blue as soon as orcs or bilwisse are located nearby .
I've never had a sword in my life .
And I hope you never have to .
If so , remember:
True courage does not mean to be able to take a life , but to preserve it .
Something's coming!
Gandalf .
Stay together!
Hurry up!
Arm yourselves!
Thieves!
Fire!
Mordio!
Radagast .
This is Radagast , the brown .
So ...
What , all over the world , are you doing here?
I've been looking for you , Gandalf .
Something's wrong .
Something's not right at all .
Yes?
Oh .
Just let me think for a second .
Oh , my God .
I had a thought , and now it's gone .
It was just there , it was already on my tongue .
Oh , my God .
It was no thought at all .
It's just a ... stick scare .
The green forest is sick , Gandalf .
A darkness has infested him .
Nothing thrives anymore .
At least nothing good .
The air stinks of decomposition .
But the worst are the nets .
Networks?
What do you mean?
Spiders , Gandalf .
Huge .
If this isn't the Brut Ungoliants , I don't want to be a magician .
I followed them .
They came from Dol Guldur .
What?
Dol Guldur?
The old fortress is abandoned .
No , Gandalf .
She's not .
A dark power dwells in her , as I have never felt one before .
It is the shadow of an ancient horror .
One who can summon the spirits of the dead .
I've seen him , Gandalf .
The darkness is a necromancer escaped .
Radagast .
Watch out!
Quick!
Quick , quick!
Wait for me!
Excuse me .
Take a train Old Tobi .
This helps to calm the nerves .
And out .
So: A Necromancer .
Are you sure?
This isn't from the world of the living .
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out here?
Wolves?
No , it's not a wolf .
Kili!
Get your bow!
Warg scouts .
Then the Ork mute can't be far away .
Orc mute?
Who , besides your family , did you tell about your plan?
No one .
Who knows about this?
No one , I swear .
What , in Durin's name , is going on here?
You're being hunted .
We have to get out of here .
We can't .
We don't have ponies .
They've gone through .
I'll lure them away .
That's Gundabad Warge .
They'll catch up with you .
And these are Rhosgobel rabbits .
I want them to try it .
Come on!
Come on!
Come and catch me!
Ha , ha!
Come on , hurry up .
Stay together .
Go on!
Ori , no!
Back up .
Come all . Come , quickly!
Where are you taking us?
Get out of here!
Run!
There they are!
This way!
Quick!
There's more to come!
Shoot them!
We're surrounded!
Where is Gandalf located?
He let us down .
Hold it!
Here , you fools!
Hurry up!
Quick!
Everybody down!
Come on , let's go!
Come on , let's go , let's go!
8 , 9 , 10 .
Kili!
Run!
Elves .
Are we following him or not?
We follow him , of course .
That would be the smartest thing .
Gandalf?
Where are we?
Do you feel it?
Yes .
It feels like ...
Well , like magic .
And that's exactly what it is .
A very powerful spell .
There's light up there .
The valley of Imladris .
Commonly , it is known under another name .
Bruchtal .
Here lies the Last Homely House east of the lake .
That's what you've been up to from the beginning .
To seek refuge with our enemies .
There are no enemies here , Thorin Oak Shield .
The only grudge you find in this valley is the one you own .
Do you think the Elves will give their blessing to our purpose?
They'll want to stop us .
Of course , they will .
But we have questions to which we need answers .
If we want to succeed , we must proceed with tact .
And respect .
And a great deal of charm .
And that's why you'll let me talk .
Mithrandir .
Ah .
Lindir .
Be careful .
I need to talk to Mr . Elrond .
My Mr . Elrond is not here .
Not here?
Where is he?
Close the rows!
Gandalf .
Mr Elrond .
Unusual for orcs to get so close to our border .
Something or someone might have lured her .
Ah .
That could have been us .
Welcome , Thorin , son of Thrain .
I don't think we know each other .
You have your grandfather's appearance .
I knew Thror when he
- King was under the mountain .
- Oh , yes?
He never spoke of you .
What did he say?
Was that an insult?
No , Master Gloin , just an invitation to dinner .
Well , if that's so , go ahead .
Come on , come on .
Try it .
A tiny appetizer . Go ahead .
No , I don't like green food .
Where's the meat?
Or fried potatoes?
Thank you for the invitation .
Even if I'm not dressed for food .
You never are .
Not quite my taste , the elves girls . Too thin .
The high cheekbones , the silk skin .
Too little facial hair , I find .
However , this one is not bad .
That's not an elve girl .
Very funny .
This is Orkrist , the Orkspalter .
A famous blade , forged by the High Elves from the West , my clan .
May it be of good service to you .
And this is Glamdring , the enemy hammer .
Sword of the King of Gondolin .
These swords were made for the orc wars in the First Age .
Don't worry about it .
Swords are called after great deeds that they accomplish in war .
Are you saying my sword hasn't seen a battle yet?
I don't even know if it's a sword .
Looks more like a letter opener .
- How did they get into your possession?
- We found them in a Troll-Hort , on the Great East Road .
- We were attacked by orcs .
- And what did you want on the Great East Road?
Excuse me .
13 Dwarves and a halfling .
Hm .
Strange traveling companions , Gandalf .
These are the descendants of the House of Durin .
Noble , decent people .
And surprisingly cultivated .
They are great admirers
- of art .
- Can't you even play something else?
I feel like I'm at a funeral .
- Did someone die?
All right , guys , I think there's only one thing that helps .
Old pitcher
Old pitcher
In the old Steinkrug Im Gasthaus
Right on the slope
There they brew a beer so brown that even the man in the moon
Came looking And lying
Long in noise
Oh
The servant has a hangover naughty
Plays fiddle all the way
His bow saws the strings across
Sometimes she squeaks up
Sometimes she's buzzing deep
There's no end in sight
The
Cat plays
Hei-didel-dum on the fiddle When he called the dead
He saws and plays the sounds fast
And the moon man shouts :
It's getting bright
Long ago the bell hit 3
Our affairs do not concern the Elves .
The card is the legacy of my people , and it is on me to protect them . My goodness , Thorin ,
Just like her secrets .
Save me from the stubbornness of the dwarfs .
Your pride will be your downfall again .
You are standing here in front of one of the few in Middle-earth who can read this map .
Show them to Mr . Elrond .
Thorin , no .
Erebor?
What interest do you have in this card?
They are mainly thought games .
As you know , such pieces sometimes contain hidden texts .
You can still read the Old Dwarf , can't you?
Moonrunes .
Of course .
Easy to overlook .
In this case , that is true .
Moon runs can only be read in the light of a moon that corresponds to the phase and season at which they were written .
Are you able to read them?
These runes were written in the evening of a summer solstice in the light of an increasing moon soon 200 years ago .
Apparently you were destined to come to Bruchtal .
Destiny is your weight ,
Thorin oak shield , because the same moon shines tonight .
Stand by the gray stone when the throttle strikes and the setting sun its last ray on Durin's day
- falling down on the keyhole .
- Durin's day?
The first day of the new year of dwarfs , when the last autumn moon and the first winter sun stand together in the sky .
Bad news .
Summer is running out .
Durin's day will be here soon .
We still have time .
- Time?
For what?
- To find the entrance .
We need to be in the right place , just at the right time .
Then , and only then , the door can be opened .
So that's your intention . You want to get into the mountain .
What if it were?
Some would not consider this wise .
What do you mean?
You are not the only one who is ready to watch over Middle Earth .
I don't want to hear excuses .
I'm sure I'm not missing .
In truth , most , I shouldn't be there on this trip .
Really?
I've heard Hobbits are very resilient .
Really?
Mmm .
And I heard they appreciated the convenience of their home .
I have heard that it is unwise to seek the advice of the Elves , because they always answer yes and no .
You are welcome , if you wish , to stay here .
But you did exactly the same thing .
Don't be so innocent .
Dori!
Here , take this .
Bombur!
Of course I wanted to tell you .
Exactly on this occasion .
You can quite trust that I know what I'm doing .
This dragon has slept for 60 years .
What if your plan fails?
- What if you wake the beast?
- What if we succeed?
When the dwarfs retake the mountain , our defense is strengthened in the east .
It's a dangerous step , Gandalf .
It is also dangerous to do nothing .
The throne of Erebor is Thorin's heir .
What are you afraid of?
Have you forgotten?
A craziness lies in this family .
His grandfather has lost his mind .
His father is succumbed to the same disease .
Can you swear that Thorin Eichenschild doesn't fall for her too?
Gandalf , these decisions do not lie with us alone .
It is not up to you or me to repaint the map of Middle Earth .
With or without our help , these dwarfs will march to the mountain .
They are determined to reclaim their homeland .
I do not believe that Thorin Eichenschild is of the opinion to be accountable .
By the way , I'm not .
You don't have to account for me .
Mrs Galadriel .
Mithrandir .
I did not know that Mr Elrond sent for you .
He didn't either .
I am .
Ah .
Saruman .
You're pretty busy , my friend .
Tell me , Gandalf , had you seriously believed that it would remain unnoticed what you are up to?
Unnoticed?
No . No .
I'm just doing what I think is right .
The dragon has been bothering you for a long time .
That's true , Mistress .
Smaug is not obliged to be faithful to anyone .
But if he allied himself with the enemy , this dragon would have a devastating effect .
With what enemy?
Gandalf , the enemy is defeated .
Sauron was defeated .
He will never regain his full strength .
Don't you worry that the last of the dwarf rings simply disappears? Along with the one who carries it?
Of the 7 dwarf rings 4 were destroyed by dragons . 2 had Sauron before he went down in Mordor .
The skill of the last dwarf ring remains unknown .
The ring Thrain wore .
Without the ruling ring of power , the 7 rings are of no value to the enemy .
To dominate the other rings , he needs the one .
That ring was lost long , long time ago .
It was washed out into the sea . From the floods of Anduin .
Gandalf , for 400 years we are now living in peace . A hard fought and worthy of protection peace .
Did we get that?
Do we have peace?
Trolls move from the mountains to the valleys .
They plunder villages , destroy farms .
Orcs attacked us on the street .
Hardly an occasion for war .
You always have to get involved . And look for problems where none are .
Let him speak .
Here is something at work that is much more vicious than Smaug .
Something far more powerful .
We can look away , but I promise you: It will not leave us unnoticed .
The green forest is sick .
The forest people there call him Dark Forest .
And they say ...
Yes?
Keep talking .
Tell us what the forest people say .
You're talking about a Necromancer in Dol Guldur .
A sorcerer who can resurrect the dead .
This is absurd .
There is no such power in this world .
This Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man .
A charlatan who tries black magic .
And that's what I was thinking , too .
- but Radagast saw ...
Radagast?
Don't tell me about Radagast , the brown .
He's a simple fool .
Well , he's weird , I admit .
He leads a lonely life .
That's not what it is .
Rather , it is due to its excessive consumption of mushrooms .
Through it his brain became soft and his teeth yellow .
I warned him .
It is not appropriate for an istari to err in such a state through the woods .
You're carrying something .
You got it from Radagast .
He found it in Dol Guldur .
Yes .
Show me .
Listen .
One could have thought , I had self-talks , inattentive as he was .
Of course , it is important to understand the wisdom of all living beings , but ...
What's that?
A relic from Mordor .
A Morgulklinge .
Forged for the witch king of Angmar .
And buried with him .
When Angmar went down , the people of the north took his body . And everything he owned , and shut it up in the rock heights of Rhudaur .
Deep in the stone they buried him , in a tomb , so dark that no light ever reached them .
That's not possible .
A powerful spell lies on these tombs .
They cannot be opened .
What evidence is there that this weapon comes from the witch king's grave?
I don't have one .
There's no one .
Let's go after what we know .
A single horde of orcs has dared over the Bruinen .
A sword from a past age was found .
And a human sorcerer , who calls himself The Necromancer , has settled in a fortress ruin at home .
Basically , that's not very much .
But I am deeply concerned about the concerns of this Zwergian enterprise .
I'm not convinced , Gandalf .
I cannot approve of such a project .
If they had come to me , I would have spared them this disappointment .
I don't understand your reasons why you gave them hope , Gandalf .
They're leaving .
Yes .
You knew .
No . There's nothing more to say about that .
My Lord Elrond .
The dwarfs , they're gone .
Take good care of everyone .
We're about to cross the border to the wilderness .
Balin , you know these paths , go ahead .
Yes .
Master Beutlin , it's time to spit .
You will follow them .
Yes .
You're right to help Thorin Oak Shield .
But I'm afraid this venture has awakened forces that we don't yet understand .
The puzzle around the Morgul blade must be solved .
Something moves in the darkness . Unseen , hidden from our gaze .
It won't show up .
Not yet .
But with each day it gains in strength .
Be careful .
Mithrandir?
Why the halfling?
I don't know .
Saruman believes that only great power can keep evil away .
But I've learned other things .
I think it's the little things , everyday actions of ordinary people who keep the darkness at a distance .
Simple acts of kindness and love .
Why Bilbo Beutlin?
Maybe because I'm afraid and he gives me courage .
Do not be afraid , Mithrandir .
You're not alone .
Careful!
Keep moving!
Ah!
Bilbo!
We have to find a shelter!
Careful!
Brother , watch out!
Cover!
It's not thundering .
This is a thunderfight!
Look!
Good heavens .
The legends are true .
Giants!
Stone giants!
Take cover , you fool!
Hold on!
What's going on?
Take my hand!
Run , go , go!
Quick , run!
Get out of here , get out of here!
- Quick!
Attention!
Attention!
Jump!
Come on!
Hang in there!
No! No!
No! No!
No! No!
Kili!
No harm done!
You're alive!
Where is Bilbo?
Where's the Hobbit?
There!
Help him!
Ah!
Hold on!
Bilbo!
Ori , be careful!
Grab my hand!
I got you , boy .
Just pack it!
Pack up!
Come on .
Get him up .
Come on , boy .
Up you go .
We almost lost our master thief .
He's been lost since we left .
He should never have come .
He's not with us .
Dwalin!
Seems safe .
Look around the back .
Caves in the mountains are rarely uninhabited .
There's nothing here .
Well , then let's make a nice fire first .
No . No .
No fire .
Not here .
Sleep a little .
At dawn we go on .
We should wait in the mountains until Gandalf joins us .
That was the plan .
Plans are changing .
Bofur , take over the first guard .
Where are you going all at once?
Back to Bruchtal .
No , you can't turn back now .
You're part of the venture .
One of us .
That's not true .
Thorin says I should never have come , and he's right .
I'm not a Tuk .
I'm a Beutlin .
What was I thinking?
I should never have left home .
You're homesick .
I understand that .
No . No .
You don't understand .
None of you understand .
You're dwarfs .
You're used to this .
A life on the street , nowhere to be settled , nowhere to belong!
I'm sorry , I didn't mean to ...
You're right .
We don't belong anywhere .
I wish you all the luck in the world .
Honestly .
What's that?
What?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Oh , man!
Watch out!
Get out of here!
Dirty pack!
Let him go!
You'll pay for that!
Now I've got you .
All right , stop pushing .
Get your dirty paws off me .
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Before you know it , I sing a song .
Pack , hack Zwick and tweak
Gripp , grapple ears off
Beating and beating
Until you're complaining
And complains
From the date of entry into the
Dark Hole
Down in the city of the Orcs
Down in the city of the Orcs
With the whip a blow until you scream , until you fief
When you're strapped onto the stretcher
Off , down into the dark hole
Down in the city of the Orcs
Down in the city of the Orcs
Hammer and axe And crack the bones
With a zack I'll pack you right away
Gossip , gossip
And tattered '
Peng , beul tremor and howl'
You can beg and beg No one will let you go
Off , down into the dark hole
Down in the city
The Orcs
Jaaa!
Go in the ear , don't you?
One of my own compositions .
This is not a song , but an abomination .
Abominableness .
Mercy .
Cruelty .
That's all you'll find down here .
Who dared to enter my kingdom armed?
Spies?
Thieves?
Homicide?
Dwarves , your malice .
Dwarves?
They were in the front entrance hall .
Well , what are you standing there for?
Search her .
From top to bottom , from all sides .
I am convinced , your bulwark , that they make common cause with the Elves .
Made in Bruchtal . Ah .
Second Age .
Completely worthless .
It's just a few souvenirs .
What led you to this area?
Don't worry , friends .
I'll do it .
Huh?
What is it?
No lies!
I want the truth , the pure truth .
You've got to talk a little louder .
Your brood trampled my funnel .
I trample even more than your funnel!
If you want to know more , then you should talk to me .
Mm-hm .
We were on a road .
It was actually more road than road .
Oh , what do I say way . If I think right , it was even just a path .
Well , at least we were on this road , so the way or path , and suddenly no more .
And that's the problem because we
- last Tuesday ...
- Shut up .
... should be in Dunland .
To visit distant relatives .
Some of my mother's inbred siblings .
Shut up!
Well , the silence pays you with infinite torments .
Bring the carnivorous .
Bring the bonebreaker .
Start with the youngest .
Wait!
Who do we have there?
Look at this .
Thorin , son of Thrain , son of Thror ,
King under the mountain .
Oh , but I forgot .
You don't have a mountain anymore .
And you're not a king either , which basically makes you a nobody .
I know someone who would pay a nice price for your head .
And only for the .
Without anything else .
Maybe you know who I'm talking about .
It's a good old enemy of yours .
A pale ork , on a white warg .
Azog , the swindler , was destroyed .
He was killed in battle . Long ago .
So you think his time as a villain is over , is that so?
Notify the bleach Ork .
Tell him I found what he's looking for .
Yes!
Yes .
Yes .
Yes!
Gollum , Gollum .
Ah!
Garstige orcs!
Better than old bones , my darling .
Better than nothing .
Too many bones , my darling .
Not enough meat!
Shut up!
Take off his skin .
At the head first .
The Knowest Land It bites the hand
It gnaws at the foot
Rock and stone No meat only leg
So cold at the end
Like the dead without breath
Is it a pleasure?
Spritz and spit , my darling .
That's a nice juicy bite .
Gollum , Gollum!
Ah .
Back up .
Stay back .
I warn you , don't come any closer .
It has an elve blade .
But it's not an elb .
No Elbse , no .
What is it , my darling?
What is it?
My name is Bilbo Beutlin .
Beutlinse?
What are Beutlinse , my darling?
- I'm a Hobbit from the Auenland .
- Oh .
We like orcs and bats and fish .
But Hobbitse we've never tasted before .
Is it tender?
Is it juicy?
Don't get too close to me!
I'll step on it if it has to be .
Ah!
I don't want any trouble , you know?
Just show me how to get out of here , and then I'm gone .
Why?
Is it lost?
Yes .
Yes , and I don't want to be lost as soon as possible .
Oh , we know!
We know safe ways for Hobbitse .
Safe ways in the dark .
I didn't say anything .
We didn't talk to him .
Oh , yes , we did , my dear .
We did .
Look , I don't know what this game is , but I ...
Play?
Oh , we love games , don't we , sweetheart?
Why play?
Does it , does it?
Does it want to play?
Possibly .
What has roots , you can hardly see them?
Is higher than all treetops stand?
Up it rises , to the light
And yet it doesn't grow
A mountain .
Yes , yes .
Oh , let's try again , shall we?
Yes!
Let's try it .
Let's try's . Ask us .
No! No!
No more puzzles .
Hit him dead .
Hit him dead right away .
Gollum , Gollum!
No! No!
No . No .
No . No .
No . No .
I want to play .
Yes , honestly .
I want to play .
I realize you can do this very well .
So , why don't we do a little puzzle game?
Yes .
Yeah , just us alone .
Yes .
Yes .
And if I win , you'll show me the way out of here , all right?
Yes .
Yes .
And if it loses?
Then what?
Well , if it loses , my darling , then we eat it .
If Beutlin loses , then we eat it on .
Agreed .
And Beutlin first .
30 mold in a red lock
First they fight
Then they stomp
Then they stand motionless
Teeth?
Teeth!
Oh , yes , my darling .
But ...
But we only have nine .
It's our turn .
Shouting voiceless
Flattered wingless
Bite toothless
Marmots
Mouthless
Wait a minute .
Uh ...
Oh .
Oh!
We know's!
We know's!
Shut up!
Wind .
The wind .
Of course .
Very well ,
Hobbitse .
Very well .
Ah , ah , ah .
A castle to which
No key fits
Closes within
A Golden Load
Castle .
Oh , uh ...
Castle , yes .
Keys ...
And?
Damn it . It's garnish .
Castle .
Keys .
Will you give up?
Oh , let's try , honey!
Let's try!
Eggs!
Eggs!
Fresh , crispy eggs .
Yes .
Grandma has shown us how to suck them out , yes!
We have one for him .
Something that consumes everything and everyone
Helmet and tanks
Axe and sword
Animal , bird
Flower , branch and foliage
It grinds dust from hard stone
Answer us .
Yes , give me a moment , please .
I've given you a lot of time .
Animal , bird ...
Bird?
Bread and leaves?
I can't believe it .
Is it delicious?
Is it tasty?
Is it crispy?
Let me think .
Let me think .
It's stuck .
Beutlin is stuck .
Time's up .
Time .
The answer is time .
Was actually quite easy .
Last question .
Last chance .
Good .
Ask us .
Ask us!
Yes , yes .
It's okay .
What do I have in my bag?
This does not apply .
This is against the rules of the game!
Ask us something else .
No , no , no .
You told me to ask you something .
And that's my question:
So , what do I have in my bag?
3 try , my dear .
3 trials .
All right , first try .
- Hands!
- Wrong .
Next try .
Fishbones , orcs , damp mussels , bat excursions ...
Knives!
Oh , shut up!
Wrong again .
Last attempt .
String .
Or nothing at all .
2 replies at once .
But also both wrong .
So ...
Come on .
I won .
You promised you'd show me the exit .
Did we , my dear?
Did we get that?
What's it got in his pockets?
It's none of your business .
You've lost .
Lost?
Lost?
Lost?
Where is he?
No! No!
Where is he?
No! No!
No! No!
Lost!
Curse and spit!
My sweetheart's gone .
What's wrong with you?
Don't ask us!
It's none of your business!
No! No!
Gollum!
Gollum!
What's it got in his nasty little pockets?
He stole it .
Stolen!
Stolen!
Bones will break
Rounded necks
It's all gonna be smashed
Killed and tormented
Here , where everyone will
Today's Cruel
Dying sees
Like's in Orkstadt
You're welcome .
I know this sword!
That's the terrible orc splitter!
The biter!
The blade that cut 1 ,000 necks!
Smash them!
Kill her!
Kill them!
Kill them all!
Cut his head off!
Take your weapons .
Fight .
Fight!
He's swinging the enemy hammer!
The bat!
Bright as daylight!
Thorin!
Follow me .
Quick!
Run!
Give it to us!
He's ours .
He's ours!
Thief!
Beutlin!
Quick!
Faster!
The pole!
Attack!
Cut the ropes!
Come on , quick!
Keep walking , let's go!
Bombur!
Run , run , run!
Jump!
Jump , boy!
Push!
Come on!
Keep walking , let's go!
Watch out , behind you!
Did you think you could escape me?
So , what are you doing now , Wizard?
That should be enough .
Well , it could have been worse .
Haver!
You're kidding me!
Gandalf!
There are too many .
We can't do that .
Only one thing can save us : daylight!
Come on!
Come on , let's go .
Come on , Balin .
Come on , let's go!
Wait!
My darling .
Wait!
Gollum , Gollum!
Quick , quick!
This way .
Run .
Come on .
Quickly .
Yeah , good!
Beutlin!
Thief!
Cursed and dismembered!
We hate it forever!
5 , 6 , 7 , 8 .
Bifur .
Bofur .
Makes 10 .
Fili , Kili!
It's 12 .
And Bombur , makes 13 .
Where is Bilbo?
Where's our Hobbit?
Where's our Hobbit?
Son of a bitch .
Now he's gone .
I thought he was with Dori!
Don't push it on me now!
Where did you last see him?
I think when they caught us , he could steal away .
What exactly happened?
- Speak!
- I'll tell you what happened .
Master Beutlin has recognized the opportunity and seized it .
Since he stepped out of his door , he has only remembered his soft bed and his warm oven .
We will not see our Hobbit again .
He's gone , long ago .
He's not .
Bilbo Beutlin .
In my whole life I've never been so happy to see anyone .
Bilbo .
We had already given up on you .
How did you get past the orcs?
Good question .
What does it matter?
He's back here .
It matters .
I want to know .
Why are you back here?
I know that you doubt me , and that from the beginning .
And you're right .
I often think of bag ends .
I miss my books .
And my chair . My garden .
That's where I belong .
This is home .
And that's why I came back .
A home .
She was taken from you .
But I want to help you get her back .
Out of the pan .
Into the fire .
Run .
Run!
Up on the trees!
Everybody , now!
Come on , climb!
Bilbo , climb up!
Quick!
They're coming!
Hold on , brothers!
Hang in there!
Azog .
That can't be .
He's falling!
Fili!
Yes!
No! No!
Oh , no .
Mr Gandalf , help!
Hold on tight , Ori .
Help!
No! No!
Thorin!
No! No!
No . No .
Thorin!
Thorin!
Thorin .
The halfling?
Don't worry .
Bilbo's here .
He's all right .
You!
What have you done?
That could have cost you your life!
Didn't I say you were a burden?
That you don't survive in the wilderness?
That you will never belong to us?
I've never been so wrong in my whole life .
Forgive my doubt about you .
No . I would have doubted myself the same way .
I'm not a hero . And I'm not a warrior either .
Not even a master thief .
Is that what I think it is?
Our homeland .
A raven!
The birds return to the mountain .
That , my dear Oin , is a throttle .
But we see it as a sign .
As a good omen .
That's right .
The worst lies behind us , I would say .
[ English
I'm thirsty over here!
Come on!
Come on!
- Here you go .
Thank you .
Careful!
Excuse me , dear .
- Come on , let's go!
- Thank you .
Master Stadel .
May I join you?
Same for me .
I should introduce myself .
My name is Gandalf .
Gandalf the Grey .
I know who you are .
Well , that's a pleasant coincidence .
What leads Thorin Eichenschild to Bree?
I learned that my father was seen in the wilderness near Dunland .
I was looking for him , but couldn't find him .
Thorin , you haven't heard anything about Thrain for a long time but rumors .
He's still alive .
I'm sure .
Before my father disappeared , he went to see you .
What did you tell him?
I urged him to march to the Erebor , to gather the 7 armies of dwarfs , to kill the dragon and bring back the Lonely Mountain .
And I'd tell you the same thing .
Get your home back .
This encounter is not a coincidence , is it , Gandalf?
No . No .
She's not .
The Lonely Mountain worries me , Thorin .
This dragon has been there long enough .
Sooner or later darker intentions will be directed to Erebor .
On the green path I came across a few unfurled figures .
They thought I was a vagabond .
What they probably regretted .
One of them carried a message .
That's black language .
A reward is promised .
For what?
Your head .
Someone wants your death .
Thorin , you can no longer wait .
You are the heir of Durin's throne .
United the armies of dwarfs .
Together you have the power to take back the Erebor .
Calls a meeting of the 7 dwarf peoples .
Requires them to stand by their oath .
The 7 armies have sworn the oath to him who bears the king's jewel .
The Arkenstein .
And in case you forgot: this gemstone was stolen , by Smaug .
What if I help you get him back?
How?
The Arkenstein is far away from here , buried under a fire-breathing dragon .
Yes , that's true .
And that's why we need a master thief .
How close is the mob?
Too close .
A few hours away , that's all .
But it gets worse .
- Did the warge storm us?
Not yet .
But they will .
- We still have a problem .
Have you been seen?
You've been seen .
No , that's not it .
What did I tell you?
Mucksmüschensilt .
Appropriate to a master thief .
Would you listen to me , please?
I'm trying to tell you that there's something else up there .
In what form?
The one of a bear?
Yes ...
Yes , but bigger .
Much bigger .
You knew about this beast?
I say we make returns .
To get caught by orcs?
There is a house , it is not far from here , and there we could seek refuge .
Whose house?
Friend or enemy?
Neither .
He's gonna help us or kill us .
Do we have a choice?
No . No .
Run!
This way .
Quick!
Run!
Bombur , come on!
To the house!
Run!
Come on , get in there .
Open the door!
Quick!
Push!
Push!
Dwalin!
Come on , guys!
What's that?
This is our host .
His name is Beorn .
And he's a skin changer .
Sometimes he is a huge black bear , sometimes a great strong person .
The bear is unpredictable , but man is to be helped with reason .
However , he does not overestimate dwarfs .
He's disappearing .
Get away from the door .
This is not natural .
None of this .
It's obvious .
A dark curse lies on him .
Don't be foolish .
The spell is a part of him .
Well then , lie down all of you sleep .
You're safe here tonight .
I hope so anyway .
So you're the one they call Oak Shield .
Tell me , why does Azog the Slayer hunt for you?
You know about Azog?
How?
My people were the first to live in the mountains before the orcs came from the north .
The villain killed almost my whole family .
But some he held as slaves .
Not for work , for pastime .
Locking skin changers and torturing them , seemed to delight him .
Is there any more like you?
Once there were many .
And now?
Now there's only one left .
You must reach the mountain before the last autumn days .
Before the Durinstag comes to an end .
Yes .
You don't have much time anymore .
That's why we have to go through the dark forest .
A darkness lies over this forest .
Cruel beings crawl around in the thicket .
The Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur have allied themselves .
Only in greatest need would I venture into it .
We'll take the Elbow Trail .
He's still safe .
Are you sure?
The forest elves of the dark forest are different .
They are less wise , but more dangerous .
But what does it matter?
What do you mean?
In this area it is teeming with orcs .
There will be more and more .
And you're on foot .
You never reach this forest alive .
I don't like dwarfs .
They are greedy and blind .
Blind for the lives of those who think they are inferior to themselves .
But I hate orcs more .
What do you need?
Go now .
As long as it's still bright .
Those who hunt you are not far anymore .
The Elbentor .
Here is our path through the dark forest .
No orcs to see .
Happiness is on our side .
Release the ponies now .
Let them return to their master .
This forest seems to be kind of sick .
It's like he's infested with suffering .
Is there really no way around?
Only if we go 200 miles north or twice as far south .
Something moves in the darkness . Unseen , hidden from our gaze .
With each day it gains strength .
Beware of the Necromancer .
He's not what he seems to be .
If our enemy has returned , we need to know that .
Go to the tombs in the mountains .
The rock heights .
Then so be it .
My horse doesn't!
I need it!
Are you going to leave us?
I wouldn't do it if I didn't have to .
You've changed , Bilbo Beutlin .
You're not the one who left the Auenland anymore .
I wanted to tell you something .
I found something in the Orcstollen .
Find what?
What did you find?
My courage .
Good .
Well , that's good .
You'll need it .
I'm waiting for you at the lookout post off the slopes of Erebor .
Keep the card and key well .
Don't go into the mountain without me .
This forest is not the green forest of former .
Even the air in the forest is full of illusions .
He will try to mislead your mind .
To mislead our minds?
What does that mean?
You have to stay on your way .
Doesn't come from him .
If you do , you will never find him again .
Whatever may come , stay on the way!
Come on .
We must reach the Erebor before the sun sets on Durin's day .
Durinstag?
Let's do it .
Only then can we find the secret door in the mountain .
Here the path continues .
This way .
I can't breathe .
In my head everything floats .
What's going on?
Keep going .
Nori , why are you stopping?
The way , he's gone .
What's happening here?
We've lost our way!
Find him .
Come on , all together , look .
Find the way!
I don't remember all this .
Nothing seems familiar to me .
But he must be here .
What hour do we have?
I don't know .
I don't even know what day we have .
Is there no end to this damned forest?
Atterkopp .
Look .
A tobacco bag .
There are dwarfs in this forest .
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains even .
He looks just like mine .
It's yours too .
Do you understand?
We're walking around in circles .
We're lost .
We didn't .
We're going further east .
And where is East?
We've lost the sun .
I thought you were a master in the field .
The sun .
We have to find them , the sun .
Up there .
We have to go beyond the treetops .
What's that?
That's enough!
Shut up , everybody!
We're being watched .
I see a lake!
And a river .
And the Lonely Mountain .
We're almost there!
Do you hear me?
I know which direction we need to go .
Hello?
Hello .
Oh , no .
Oh , don't .
Kill them!
Kill them .
Eating right away while her blood is still flowing .
Her fur is tough , but inside they are pretty juicy .
Stitch it again .
Stitch it again .
Kill it .
The meat is lively!
Kill him .
Kill him now .
Let's eat .
Eat!
Eat!
Eat!
Eat!
Eat alive!
Eat!
What is it?
What is it?
Eat alive!
Fat and juicy .
Just a little bite .
Damn it!
Where is it?
Where is it?
Here .
Ah!
It's stinging!
Stitch!
Stitch .
A good name .
Stitch .
Are you all right , Bofur?
I'm all right!
Go away , pull it away!
Where is Bilbo?
I'm up here!
Take your legs!
Pull!
Pull!
Oh , where is he?
Where is he?
Come on .
Where is he?
No! No!
No! No!
No! No!
Come on , hurry up!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Watch out , brother!
Fili!
Mine .
Come on , hurry up!
They're gone!
Don't think I wouldn't kill you , dwarf .
It would be my pleasure .
Help!
Kili!
Throw me a dagger!
Quick!
If you think I'll give you a gun , dwarf , then you're wrong .
Search her .
Hey!
Give it to me!
That's personal!
Who's that?
- Your brother?
And the other , greyish creature?
An orc-change bellows .
That's my little boy . Gimli .
Where did you get this?
It was given to me .
Not only a thief , but also a liar .
Thorin , where is Bilbo?
You'll be sorry for that!
- Did you hear that?
Let's get out of here!
Don't touch me!
Aren't you going to search me?
I could have anything in my pants .
Or nothing .
Stop it!
We can't get out of here!
This isn't an orc dungeon .
These are the halls of the Waldland Empire .
No one gets out of here without the king's consent .
Your journey may seem like a noble destination .
You want to take back your homeland and kill a dragon .
I myself suspect behind your actions rather less noble motives .
You're planning a theft or something like that .
You've found a way in .
You seek what gives you the right to rule .
The King's Jewel .
The Arkenstein .
It is extremely valuable to you .
I understand that .
In this mountain there are gemstones that I also desire .
White stones of pure starlight .
I offer you my help .
I'm all ears .
I will let you go if you give me back what is mine .
A favor for a favor .
I give you my word .
From one king to another .
I don't believe that Thranduil , the great king , keeps his word , even though the end of all days is coming .
You're missing all honor!
I've seen how you treat your friends .
Once we came to you , starving , homeless , and asked for your help .
But you turned away .
You have taken no part in the suffering of my people and the Inferno that has destroyed us .
Don't tell me about dragon fire .
I know how angry and lethal it is .
I was already fighting against the great fire snakes of the north .
I warned your grandfather of what would cause his greed .
But he didn't want to hear .
You're just like him .
Stay here if you want , and rot .
100 years are just an eyelash in the life of an elve .
I'm patient .
I can wait .
Has he proposed a trade?
Yes .
I told him îsh kakhfê ai -'dûr-rugnu!
On his and that of his kinship!
Well , that was's then , I guess .
A trade was our only hope .
Not our only hope .
I know you're here .
Say , why are you walking in the shadow?
I wanted to report to you .
Had I not ordered to destroy this nest , less than 2 moons ago?
We cleaned the forest as ordered , my king .
They multiply in the ruins of Dol Guldur .
We could already kill them there ...
This fortress is beyond our borders .
Keep these creatures away from our realm .
That's your job .
And if we have driven them out? What then?
Do they not spread to other countries?
Other countries are not my concern .
The fortunes of the world bring rise and demise .
But here , in this kingdom , we will survive .
Legolas said you fought well today .
He's very close to you .
I assure you , my king , Legolas sees nothing in me but the leader of the guard .
That may have been so .
Now I'm not so sure anymore .
I don't think you'd allow your son to promise himself a simple forest elve .
No , certainly , I wouldn't .
Still , he likes you .
Don't make him hope where none is .
The stone in your hand , what is it?
A lucky charm .
A powerful spell lies on it .
If someone other than a dwarf reads these runes , he's cursed forever .
Or not .
Depends on whether you believe in such a thing .
It's just a souvenir .
A Runenstein .
My mother gave it to me so I could think of my promise .
What promise?
That I'm going back to her .
She's worried .
She thinks I'm daring .
Is it you?
No . No .
There seems to be a big celebration going on up there .
It's Mereth e-nGilith , the Starlight Festival .
All light is holy to the Eldar .
But most of all forest elves love the light of the stars .
I always found , it's a cold light .
Unapproachable and far away .
It is memory , especially precious and pure .
Like your promise .
I sometimes went there .
Beyond the forest and up into the night .
I have seen the world disappear . And the white light of eternity fills the air .
I saw a fire moon once .
He went up over the pass at Dunland .
Huge .
Red and golden , the whole sky was shining .
We escorted a group of merchants from the Ered Luin .
They exchanged silverwork for furs .
We took the green road to the south , the mountains to our left .
And then he appeared .
This huge moon of fire and enlightened our way .
I wish I could show you the caves under these mountains .
Galion , old crook , we have nothing more to drink .
The empty barrels should have been sent back to Esgaroth hours ago .
I'm sure the barge's waiting .
That must be left to our evil-tempered king: He understands of wine .
Come on , Elros , try a sip .
I have to guard the dwarfs .
They're locked up .
Where are they going?
Ha , ha .
I bet the sun will rise soon .
The day is about to start .
We'll never reach the mountain , will we?
As long as you're in here , certainly not .
Bilbo!
What?
Punch!
There are guards everywhere!
- Ha , ha , ha .
Close the doors .
- That's how we gain time .
- All right , Nori .
Up the stairs .
You first .
Ori .
Not that way .
Down here .
Follow me .
Come on .
Careful .
Over here .
Come on .
There's no way!
We're in the basement!
You should get us out of here and not go deeper!
I know what I'm doing .
Punch!
Over here!
Over here!
Come on , - everyone in the barrels , quickly .
Are you crazy?
- Then they'll find us .
No , no .
They won't , I promise .
Please , please , you have to trust me .
Do what he says .
DWALIN Put your big carrot head in there .
Come on , Bifur . Get in the barrel .
Come on , let's go , let's go , let's go!
Everybody in there .
So what do we do now?
Take a deep breath .
Take a deep breath?
Why is that?
Where's the guard with the keys?
Well done , Master Beutlin .
Go on!
Come on!
Hold on!
Bilbo!
Hold on!
Help!
Ori!
No! No!
Watch out!
There's orcs!
Under the bridge!
Kili!
Kili!
Kili .
Kili!
Nori!
Hit the tree trunk!
Bombur!
Tauriel .
Oh , you!
Why am I here , Gandalf?
Trust me , Radagast .
I wouldn't have called you without a good reason .
For a meeting not a nice place .
No , it's not .
These are dark spells , Gandalf .
Old and full of hate .
Who's buried here?
If he had a name , he's long forgotten .
He would only be known as a servant of evil .
One of a bunch .
One out of nine .
Why now , Gandalf?
I don't understand .
The ring spirits were called to Dol Guldur .
But it can't be the Necromancer .
A human sorcerer could not summon such an evil .
Who says something about human?
The Nine obey only one Lord .
We were blind , Radagast .
And in our blindness the enemy has returned .
He summons his servants . Why?
Azog the Shaker is not just a hunter .
He's a leader .
He commands legions .
The enemy is preparing for war .
It will begin in the east .
He's after this mountain .
- Where are you going?
- Back to the others .
Gandalf .
I've started it .
I won't let her down .
They are in greatest danger .
If it's true what you say , the whole world is in greatest danger .
The power in this fortress will become even stronger .
You want me to leave my friends behind?
Is there anything behind us?
As far as I can see , not .
Believe , we've lost the orcs .
Not for long , without current .
Bombur's half drowned .
- Everybody to the shore!
- Good .
Come on , hurry up!
Gloin , help me , brother .
Come on , get up .
Come on!
Come on , you big chunk!
I'm fine , it's nothing .
Get up!
Kili is wounded .
His leg needs to be connected .
An Orkmeute follows us .
We have to keep going .
And where?
To the mountain .
We're close .
A lake lies between us and the mountain .
- We have nothing to cross it .
- Let's go around it .
Then the Orcs will kill us .
We have no weapons to defend ourselves .
Connects his leg , fast .
You have two minutes .
Do it again , and you're dead .
Excuse me , but , you must be from the sea city , if I'm not mistaken .
This barge you have there , that wouldn't happen to rent?
What makes you think I'd help you?
Your boots have seen better days .
Just like your coat .
And no doubt you have to stuff hungry mouths .
How many calves?
A boy and two girls .
And your wife , I think , is a beauty .
Yes .
That was her .
Forgive me .
It wasn't my intention ...
Oh , come on , stop .
No more courtesies .
Why are you in such a hurry?
What do you care?
I'd like to know who you are and what brings you to this area .
We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains , traveling to our relatives in the Iron Mountains .
Simple merchants , you say?
We need food , supplies , weapons .
Can you help us?
I know where these barrels came from .
And if you do .
I don't know what you had to do with the Elves . It didn't go well .
You need the mayor's permission to come to the seaside town .
All his wealth comes from the trade with the Waldland Empire .
He puts you in chains rather than that he awakens the wrath of Thranduil .
Offer him more .
I bet you get to the city somehow also unseen .
Yes .
But you'd need a smuggler for that .
And we'll pay him twice as much .
That's the essence of evil .
Out there , in ubiquitous ignorance , it blackens and spreads:
a shadow that grows in the dark .
A sleepless malice , as black as the rising darkness of the night .
That's how it's always been .
That's how it will always be .
Over time , all rot comes to light .
You've been following a community of 13 dwarfs .
Why?
None 13 .
Not anymore .
The young , the black-haired archer , our Morgul arrow has hit him .
The poison is in his blood .
And soon he will suffocate it .
Answer the question , Scheusal .
I'd rather not upset her .
You like to kill , Ork?
You like death?
Then I want to give it to you .
I don't care about a dead dwarf .
Answer the question .
You have nothing to fear .
Tell us what you know , and I will free you .
You had the order to kill her .
Why?
What is Thorin Eichenschild to you?
This munchy dwarf will never be king .
King?
There is no king under the mountain , and there will never be one either .
No one dares to go to the Erebor as long as the dragon lives .
You don't know anything .
Your world will burn .
What are you talking about?
Speak!
Our time begins anew .
My master serves the One .
Do you understand now , Elbling?
Death is ahead of you .
The flames of war are ahead of you .
Why did you do that?
You had promised to free him .
I did .
I have freed his wretched shoulders from his pathetic skull .
This Ork could have told us more .
He couldn't have told me more .
What did he mean by flames of war?
It means they will unleash a power that is so powerful that they destroy everything in their way .
Double the guards at our borders!
On all paths , all rivers .
Nothing happens without that I know about it .
No one gets into this kingdom .
And no one leaves it .
Careful!
I was born and raised by these waters , Master Dwarf .
If I wanted to drown you , I wouldn't do it here .
Oh , that presumptuous seaman .
I say we throw him overboard , then rest .
- Oh , Bard , the man's name is Bard .
How do you know that?
Ah , I asked him .
I don't care what his name is .
I don't like him .
We don't have to like him .
We just have to pay him .
Come on , boys .
Turn your pockets around .
How do we know he's not betraying us?
Not at all .
We are missing 10 coins .
Gloin .
Come on .
- Give us what you have .
- Don't look at me like that .
This trip made me bleed out completely .
And what did I get for my expenditure?
Nothing but sorrow and misery and ...
With my beard .
Take it .
- Take it all .
- Ahem .
The money , quickly .
We will not pay you until we have our supplies .
If you love freedom , you do what I say .
There are guards in front .
What's he doing?
He's talking to someone .
Now he's pointing right at us .
Now they shake hands .
- What?
Traitor .
He wants to turn us in .
Shut up now .
We'll get to the customs gate .
Stop!
Control of goods!
Papers , please!
Oh , it's you , Bard .
Tomorrow , Peredur .
Do you have anything to sign up for?
Nothing , I'm just frozen and tired and I want to go home .
Then you're just like me .
Here you go .
It's all right .
Not so hasty .
Delivery of empty barrels from the Waldland kingdom .
Just they're not empty , right , Bard?
If I remember correctly , you have a permit as a barge leader .
And not as a fisherman .
It's none of your business .
Error .
It's the mayor's business and so it's my business .
Oh , come on , Alfrid , have a heart .
People need to eat .
This fish is not approved .
Tilts the barrels
- overboard .
- You heard's .
Put it in the channel .
Come on .
Hurry up .
The citizens of the city suffer hardship .
Times are hard .
Food is scarce .
That's not my problem .
Stop .
Always prince riders of the people , what , Bard?
The protector of the little people .
You still have their support , Kahnführer , but not for long .
Open the gate!
The mayor has an eye on you .
You'd better remember that .
We know where you live .
Is a small town , Alfrid .
Everyone knows about everyone where he lives .
The whole talk of internal unrest .
Someone stirs up the fire , Lord .
Does the gout make you feel better , Lord?
That's the humidity , what else?
Get me a brandy .
The mood of the people , Lord , becomes insolent .
The common people , Alfrid , has always been rebellious .
What can I do for them to live in a place that smells of tran and tar?
Work , Housing , Eating .
Every day the same thing . Stupid and complaining .
I believe they are inflated by troublemakers , Lord .
CITIZENS: Then we have to find the troublemakers and lock them up .
That's what I think , Lord .
And this talk of change must be stopped .
I can't afford the mob to get together and tuck up .
Next they start and ask questions , gather , initiate investigations .
Let's go with the old , let's go with the new one .
What?
That's what everyone says , Lord .
Some even munkle of elections .
Of elections?
This is absurd .
As if I'd allow that .
I don't think anyone would ask that , Lord .
Presseberger .
Unthankful pack .
People's plotters .
Who would be so bold to question my authority?
Who would dare?
Who?
Bard .
Yeah , I'm pretty sure .
This troublemaker from a barge leader is behind it .
Take your hands away .
You didn't see her .
They were never here .
You can have the fish for free .
Follow me .
Father!
Our house , it is observed .
Tell the mayor I'm done for today .
Father!
Where were you?
Father!
There you are!
I was so worried .
Here , Sigrid .
Bain , bring her in .
If you tell anyone , I'll rip out both of your arms .
Hands off .
Upstairs .
Father , why do all the dwarves come out of our toilet?
Will they bring us luck?
They may not fit quite , but they keep you warm .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
A dwarf wind lance .
Have you seen a ghost?
He did .
The last time we saw a gun like this , a city was in flames .
It was the day the dragon came .
The day Smaug Thal destroyed .
Girion , the prince of Thal , let his archers shoot at the beast .
But a dragon skin is thick .
Thicker than the strongest armor .
Only a black arrow , shot down by a wind lance , can penetrate the skin of the dragon .
And few such arrows were ever forged .
The supply was running out when Girion made the last attempt .
If he hadn't missed his goal then , much would have happened differently .
Sounds like you were there .
All dwarfs know the story .
Then you would know that Girion hit the dragon .
He loosened a scaffold under the left wing .
Another arrow and he would have killed the beast .
It's a child's story , kid .
Nothing more .
You took our money .
Where are the weapons?
Wait here .
Tomorrow will begin the last autumn days .
And Durin's day is the day after tomorrow .
We have to reach the mountain first .
What if we don't make it?
What if we haven't found the secret door by then?
Then the whole way was for nothing .
What's that supposed to be?
A skewer's hook .
Made from an old harpoon .
- And this?
A crow's beak , that's what we call it .
From a blacksmith's hammer .
Is heavy in the hand , admittedly , but in defense of your life it is truly better than nothing .
We paid you for weapons .
Iron forged swords and axes!
This is a joke!
You can't find anything better outside the city's armory .
All forged weapons are locked there .
Thorin , let's take what's there and go .
I've been out with less , and so have you .
- I say we leave .
- You're not going anywhere .
What did you say?
Spies watch the house , and probably every jetty and investor in the city .
You have to wait until it gets dark .
Thorin .
Father?
Don't let her go .
Tauriel , you can't hunt 30 orcs alone .
I'm not alone .
You knew I'd come .
The king is angry , Tauriel .
My father has been protecting you for 600 years , prefers you .
And you don't follow his orders .
Missing his trust .
The king has never allowed Orcs to pass through our country .
But now he lets them cross the border and kill our prisoners .
This is not our fight .
It's our fight .
It won't end here .
With every victory , evil becomes even stronger .
If it's up to your father , we won't do anything .
We hide behind walls , lead a life away from the light and let the darkness prevail .
Aren't we part of this world?
Tell me , mellon .
When did we allow evil to become stronger than us?
Well , Bard .
What are you looking for?
Here was a tapestry!
An old one!
Where did he go?
What tapestry do you mean?
This one .
Those were dwarfs , I tell you .
Came out of nowhere .
Whirlpool beards , wild eyes .
I've never seen anything like it .
What do dwarfs have to do in our area?
- That's the prophecy .
Prophecy?
The prophecy about Durin's people .
The prophecy .
Prophecy .
The old stories come true .
Powerful halls full of treasures .
Can this really be true?
Has the Lord of the Silver Sources returned?
The Lord of the Silver Sources
The King of Noble Stone
The King Under the Mountain
Take what is his!
Happy is the bells customer
Whether the King
Return
But everything is perishing
And the sea will be a sea of flames
Father , I tried to stop her!
How long have they been gone?
Do you see anything?
Not so loud .
As soon as we have the weapons , we leave immediately to the mountain .
Come on , let's go , let's go .
Come on , Nori .
Next .
Is it going to work?
I'll be all right .
Let's get out of here .
Run!
Hurry up!
Get your hands off me!
Bring her over here .
Get them legs!
What's this uproar?
We caught them when they tried to steal weapons , Lord .
So treason , huh?
Only a poor bunch of mercenaries , if you ask me , Lord .
Watch your tongue!
You don't know who you're dealing with .
This isn't just some scoundrel .
This is Thorin , son of Thrain , son of Thror!
We are the Dwarves Erebors .
And we have come to reclaim our home .
I remember this city in ancient times .
Whole merchant fleets lay in port , loaded with silk and gemstones .
This was not a forgotten city on a lake .
This was the center of any trade in the north!
I'll get this time back .
We re-ignite the great forges of the dwarves , so that prosperity and wealth re-flow , from the halls of Erebor!
Death!
You'll bring this over to us!
Dragon fire and destruction!
If you wake the beast , you will destroy us all .
You can listen to this black painter , but I promise you:
If it succeeds , everyone will participate in the wealth of the mountain .
Then you have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times!
All of you!
Listen to me!
You have to listen!
Have you forgotten what happened to Thal?
Have you forgotten the ones who left their lives in the firestorm?
And what's all this for?
For a mountain king blind ambition . So devoured by greed that he only has his own advantage in mind!
Please , please!
We can , and this applies to all of us , not to blame anyone hastily .
And let us not forget: It was Girion , the prince of Thal ,
True , sir .
We all know the story .
Arrow by arrow he shot .
Everyone missed their goal .
You have no right .
No right to enter this mountain .
I alone have the right .
I'm speaking to the mayor of Seestadt .
Do you want to see the prophecy come true?
Do you want to participate in the great wealth of our people?
What do you say?
I say to you ...
Welcome!
Welcome!
And 3 times welcome , King under the mountain!
We're one too few , by the way .
Where is Bofur located?
- If he's not here , we'll leave him behind .
- We have to , if we want to find the door before nightfall .
We can't lose any more time .
You don't .
We have to hurry .
You'd stop us .
It has to be done with .
What are you talking about , I'll come with you , of course .
No . No .
I'll be there when this door opens .
When we first see the halls of our fathers , Thorin .
Kili . Stay here .
Rest .
Come after when you're healthy .
I'll stay with the boy .
The wounded are my duty .
Uncle .
We grew up with the stories about the mountain .
You told us .
You can do that to him .
- don't take away!
- Fili .
I wear it if it has to be!
One day you will be king and understand .
I can't risk the fate of this venture for a dwarf .
Not even for my nephew .
Fili , don't be a fool .
You belong to the community .
I'm with my brother .
With my beard , it's already so late?
Ah!
So break up now , with our goodwill and best wishes .
- And may your return all ...
Wait!
...happy luck!
Goodbye!
Get out of the way!
No! No!
Ha .
Did you miss the boat too?
Kili?
Kili!
No . No .
I've had enough of dwarfs .
Get out of here!
No , no , no!
Please!
No one wants to help us .
Kili is sick .
Very sick .
What is this place?
Once upon a time this was the city of Thal .
Now it's a ruin .
It's just Smaug's wasteland .
The sun soon reaches its zenith .
We must find the secret door in the mountain before it goes down .
This way .
Wait!
Is this the lookout post?
Gandalf said we should meet here .
- There's no way we should ...
- Do you see him?
We can't wait for the wizard .
We're on our own .
Come on!
Dol Guldur .
The Hill of Magic .
It looks completely abandoned .
As it is intended .
A magic banner camouflage this place . Which means , our enemy is not yet ready to show up .
He has not yet attained his full strength .
Radagast , deliver a message to Mrs . Galadriel:
Tell her we have to force him to act .
What do you mean?
I'm going in alone .
And by no means can you follow me .
Do I have your word?
Yes , yes , yes , yes!
Wait , Gandalf!
Maybe this is a trap!
Go back and don't come back!
It is undoubtedly a trap .
Do you see anything?
Nothing!
If the card is right , the secret door is right above us .
Up here!
You have sharp eyes , Bilbo Beutlin .
That must be her .
The secret door .
Should all who doubted us regret this day!
All right , then .
We have a key .
That means , somewhere there is also a keyhole .
The last ray on Durin's day will fall down on the keyhole .
Nori .
The light is fading .
Come on .
Shut up!
I don't hear anything when you kick it .
I can't find it .
It's not here!
It's not here!
Hit her!
Yes!
Come on!
Break!
She has to break!
That's no use .
The door is sealed .
You can't get to her by force .
A powerful spell lies on it .
No! No!
... her last beam falls down on Durin's day on the keyhole .
That's what it says here .
What have we overlooked?
What have we overlooked?
Balin?
The light is gone .
There's nothing we can do .
We just had this one try .
Let's go .
It's over .
Wait a minute .
We were too late .
Where are they going?
You mustn't give up now!
Thorin .
You can't give up now .
Stand by the gray stone when the throttle strikes .
The setting sun lets its last ray fall down on Durin's day .
The last beam .
The last beam .
The last beam!
The keyhole!
Come back!
Come back!
It is the light of the moon .
The last moon of autumn!
Ha , ha , ha .
Where's the key?
Where's ...?
He was here .
Oh , he was ...
He was lying here .
He was just lying ...
Erebor .
Thorin .
I know these walls .
These halls .
This stone .
Remember , Balin?
Chambers , filled with golden light .
I remember .
Herein lies the Seventh Kingdom , home of Durin's people .
May the heart of the mountain unite all dwarfs to defend this homeland .
The King's throne .
Ah .
And what's that about it?
The Arkenstein .
The Arkenstein .
And what's that?
That's the reason , Master Thief , why you're here .
Can't you do anything?
I need herbs .
Something to lower his fever .
I have nightshade .
I have dog chamomile .
They don't use me .
Don't you have a king's herb?
No , that's weeds .
That's how we feed the pigs .
Pigs?
Weeds .
Exactly .
Don't move .
You want me to find a gemstone?
A large white gemstone .
Yes .
That's it?
There must be a lot down there .
There is only one Arkenstein . And you recognize it when you see it .
Ah , yes .
The truth is , boy , I don't know what you'll find down there .
You don't have to go if you don't want to .
It is not dishonorable to turn back .
No , Balin .
I promised , I'd do it , and I think I should try .
It always amazes me .
What?
The courage of the Hobbits .
Go now , with all the luck you can bring up .
Oh , Bilbo?
Should actually be a living dragon down there , then don't wake him .
Where is your master?
Where is he?
Sauron!
Hello?
He's not home .
Not at home .
Ahem .
Good .
Good , good , good .
What's that?
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Arkenstein .
Arkenstein .
A large white gemstone .
Very helpful .
So ...
Thief , I can smell you .
I can hear your breath .
I feel you're here .
Where are you?
Where are you?
Come on , don't be shy .
Come into the light .
Hm .
There's something about you .
Something you carry with you .
Something of gold .
But it is a much bigger treasure .
Honey!
Honey!
Ah , there you are , thief walking in the shadow .
I didn't intend to steal from you . Oh , Smaug you immeasurably rich .
I just wanted to make sure of your glory .
To see if you're really as tall as the old stories tell .
I didn't believe it .
And do you believe it now?
Truly , all songs and legends remain far behind your monstrousness . Oh , Smaug you immeasurable .
Do you think flattery will save your life?
No , no .
No , indeed .
My name you seem to know , but I can't remember to have smelled like you before .
Who are you? And where do you come from , if I may ask?
I come from under the Bühl .
Under the Bühl?
Yes , and my way also led me under mountain and over mountain .
And ...
And through the air too .
I am the walking invisible .
Impressive .
What else do you claim to be?
I'm a ...
Lucky lucky charm .
Puzzle Solicitor .
Dearest , these titles .
Continue .
Fassreiter .
Barrels?
That's interesting .
And what about your little dwarf friends?
Where are they hiding?
Dwarf friends?
No . No .
No . No .
No , dwarfs are not here .
You misunderstood .
Oh , I don't think so , Fassreiter!
They sent you to leave the dangerous work to you while they sneak around outside .
Truly , you are mistaken , Oh , Smaug , you most venerable and appalling of all disasters .
You have good manners for a thief and a liar!
I know the smell and taste of dwarfs .
I don't know anything better!
It's the gold!
They are attracted by treasures like flies of dead meat .
You think I didn't know this day was coming?
That a mob of hypocritical dwarfs is crawling back to the mountain?
Was that an earthquake?
That , my boy , was a dragon .
Father?
That's from the mountain .
You should get out of here .
Take your children .
Get away from here .
And where?
We can't go anywhere .
Will we die , Father?
No , honey .
The dragon .
He's gonna kill us all .
Not if I kill him first .
The king under the mountain is dead .
I took his throne and ate myself full of his people , like a wolf among sheep .
I kill wherever I want , and when I want .
My tank is like iron .
No blade can penetrate me .
All right , go on .
A black arrow?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because you didn't need to know .
Now listen to me .
You have to distract the guards .
As soon as I'm up on the tower , I put the arrow in the bow .
There he is!
Bard!
- There you go!
Get him!
Get down there .
Run!
Hold him!
Hold him!
Stop!
Bain!
Bain .
Hide it well .
No one can find him .
I'll deal with them .
- I won't leave you alone .
- Get out of here!
Braga .
You're under arrest .
- What are you throwing at me?
- Everything the mayor likes .
Where'd he go?
Where's Bilbo?
We'll give him time .
Time? What for?
To be killed?
You're afraid .
Yes , I'm afraid .
I'm afraid for you .
This treasure is infected by a disease .
She drove your grandfather crazy .
I'm not my grandfather .
You're not yourself .
The Thorin , whom I know , would not hesitate to go in ...
I'm not risking this venture for the life of a thief .
Bilbo .
His name is Bilbo .
It's oak shield . The filthy dwarf and throne robber .
He sent you . He wants the Arkenstein , doesn't he?
No . No .
No , no . I don't know what you're talking about .
Don't try to deny it .
I suspected his evil intention long ago .
But that is meaningless .
Eichenschild's venture will fail .
The darkness is breaking in .
It penetrates into every corner of the country .
Thief walking in the shadow . You are nothing more than a means to an end .
The coward oak shield has weighed the value of your life and considered it worthless .
No . No .
No . No .
No , you're lying .
What did he promise you?
A share of the treasure?
It's like he's his own .
I will not separate myself from any single coin .
Not a single piece of it .
My teeth are swords .
My claws are spears .
My wing blow is a hurricane!
So it's true .
The black arrow has found its destination .
What did you say?
I just said that your reputation is ahead of you , oh , Smaug you Tyrant .
Truly , no one comes like you in this world .
It almost lures me to let you .
And be it just to see how oak shield suffers .
To see it destroy him .
To see it contaminate his heart , and drive him mad .
But I'd rather not .
Our little game ends here .
So tell me , thief , what do you want for death?
No . No .
Father?
Is it you , Father?
- Ah!
Get down here!
Down!
You've all killed .
There are more coming .
Tauriel .
Come on .
He won't last much longer!
Tauriel .
Athelas .
Athelas .
What are you going to do?
I'll keep him from dying .
- You're alive!
- Not for very long .
- Did you get the Arkenstein?
The Arkenstein!
- The dragon is coming .
Did you find him?
We have to get out of here .
Thorin .
Thorin .
You'll burn!
- Run!
- Ah!
Come on , Bilbo!
Come on .
Hold him tight .
Ah!
Tilda .
Psh , Psh , Psh!
We must have shaken him off .
No . No .
For that he is too cunning .
And where now?
Into the western guard room .
There may be an exit .
It's too high .
Doing That
- we don't .
- That's the only way .
We have to try .
Come on .
I've heard of the wonders of the Elbe medicine .
It was a great honor to watch this .
Tauriel .
Rest .
It can't be you .
It's a long way away .
It is far , far away from me .
She wanders in the starlight of another world .
It was just a dream .
Do you think she could have loved me?
Stay together .
This is where it ends .
There's no way out of here .
The last of our family .
They must have come here because they still had hope where there was no more .
We could try to reach the mines .
Then maybe we'll stay a few more days .
No . No .
That's not how I'm gonna die .
Causing .
Rugging for breath .
We're going to the blacksmiths .
He will see us . Deadly sure .
Not if we split up .
Thorin , we'll never make it .
A few of us might be .
Locks Smaug to the blacksmiths .
We kill the dragon .
If it ends already in the fire , then we will perish together in it .
This way!
Flee .
Flee .
Run for your life .
You can't hide .
Behind you!
Worm!
Come on!
Run!
Hey , you!
Here!
This way!
We have to go this way!
Come on!
Thorin!
Go with Balin!
- Thorin .
- Come here!
Thorin!
Hold on!
Thorin!
Come on .
Come on!
Our plan doesn't work .
These ovens are ice cold .
He's right .
We don't have a fire that's hot enough to ignite it .
Maybe it is .
I didn't think you were so easy to outwit .
You've slowed down . And fat . You're poor age .
Cover .
Now!
Bombur!
Get the bellows going .
Go on!
Bilbo!
Up there!
On my signal you pull down the lever .
Balin!
Do you still get a stabbing flame?
Yes .
It'll only take a moment .
Come on!
We don't have a moment .
Where's the sulfur?
Do you know what you're doing?
Come on!
Now!
Lock him in the Ancestor Hall of the Kings .
Go on , Bilbo!
Run!
Do you think you could fool me , Fassreiter?
You're from the sea town .
This is some stupid prank from these filthy dwarves and the wretched kegs from the lake .
These pathetic cowards with their longbows and black arrows .
Maybe it's time I paid them a visit .
Oh , no .
It's not your fault!
Wait!
You can't go to the seaside town!
You care about them , don't you?
Good .
Then watch them die .
Here!
You simple worm .
You!
I'll get back what you stole .
You won't take anything from me , dwarf .
I once struck down your warriors .
I have put the peoples in fear and terror .
I am king under the mountain .
This is not your kingdom .
This is Dwarfland .
This is dwarf gold .
And we get our revenge .
Revenge?
Revenge?
I'll show you what revenge is!
Listen to me!
Don't you know what will come?
I'm a fire .
I'm death .
What have we done?
I warned you .
Didn't I warn you about what happens when you get involved with dwarfs?
Now they've done it .
They have awakened the dragon and brought death and destruction upon us!
Come on .
Quickly .
Faster now!
I want to get to safety at last .
Careful!
Leave the books!
Go on!
But Lord , shouldn't we try to save the city?
The city is lost .
- Save the gold!
You heard him .
Make it faster .
Father!
Come on .
To a pile!
We don't have time .
We have to go .
Help him up .
Come on , brother .
- Come on .
Come on , come on .
- Let go of me .
I can go .
- As soon as possible .
- We're not going .
Not without our father .
If you stay , your sisters will die .
Would your father want that?
Let me out of here!
Do you hear me?
I see him!
Father!
Down here!
Come on!
Give me your hand .
Come on , we have to go .
Hurry up .
Quickly .
Kili , come on!
Try to reach the shore!
MAN 2: Let's go , let's go!
The dragon!
Come on , come on!
Faster!
Faster!
Couldn't we just take a few more of these poor people with us , but they wouldn't be able to ...
- Worth it .
Quite my opinion .
Help!
Help!
Attention!
Move!
Move!
Come on!
Faster!
My gold!
My gold!
We're too heavy loaded .
We have to throw off ballast .
That's right .
Alfrid .
Faster!
Faster!
Poor people .
Father .
Father!
Hit him!
- He hit the dragon!
- No , I'm not .
He's hit him!
I saw's .
His arrows can't penetrate his tank .
Nothing can do that .
What are you doing?
Come back!
Bain!
Bain!
Bain!
Come back!
Bain!
Leave him alone .
We can't turn back .
Bain!
Father .
Bain!
Why are you still here?
You were supposed to escape!
- I wanted to help you .
- No , no , no , no , no .
Nothing can stop him anymore .
This may already be .
Bain .
Go back now .
Get out of here .
Do you hear me?
Father!
No! No!
Stop , stop , stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Who are you that you dare to stand up to me?
Oh , what a shame .
What are you going to do now ,
Archer?
You're abandoned .
Help will not come .
Now or never!
Come on!
Come on!
Get out on the open water!
Hmm .
Is that your child?
You can't save him from the fire .
He's gonna burn!
Hold still , son .
Hold still .
Tell me Wicht , how could someone like you become dangerous to me?
You have nothing left but your death!
Bain .
Look at me .
Look at me .
A little to the left .
That's good .
Bain!
Hold on!
What was that?
What happened?
He crashed .
I saw's .
He's dead .
Smaug is dead .
With my beard , I think he's right .
Look , there!
The ravens Erebors return to the mountain .
Yes .
The message will spread .
Not for long , then everyone knows in all Middle Earth: The dragon is dead!
You are not alone ,
Mithrandir .
Help!
Where's my child?
Please!
Why don't you help me?
Help!
Over there!
Father!
Father!
Father!
- Father!
Aah!
Why me?
Tauriel .
Kili!
Come on .
We're leaving!
These are your people .
You have to keep going .
Come with me .
I know how I feel .
I'm not afraid .
You make me feel alive .
I can't .
Tauriel .
I don't know what that means .
I think so .
One more time!
Keep him .
As a promise .
They're dry .
You'll need them .
Thank you .
- Here .
Give me one of them .
In this cold , I get my death .
Find yourself one!
You have nothing more to say , Alfrid Leckspuckel .
You're wrong .
If the mayor is absent , the power passes to his deputy , and that's me .
Now give me the blanket!
Deputy Mayor?
That I'm not laughing .
Ripped thief hit it better .
I'd rather die than follow you .
Maybe this can be arranged .
Do not turn against the likes of you , Alfrid .
Not now .
- Father!
- Come here!
You're alive!
It's all right , my dears .
It was Bard!
He killed the dragon!
I saw it with my own eyes .
He killed the beast!
He did it with a black arrow .
Thank you , Bard! Thank you!
Well done .
Thank you!
You saved all of us!
We thank you .
A high on the Dragon Killer!
A high on King Bard!
I've said it many times .
This is a man of noble house .
- A born leader!
Don't call me that .
I'm not the mayor of this city .
Where is he?
- The mayor!
The Anduin downstream .
With all our money . No doubt .
You know it .
You've got the treasure chamber with him
- Plundered .
- No , I'm not .
I tried to stop him .
Liar!
- You thief!
You son of a bitch!
I begged .
I begged .
Let's get him out of here!
Tarry him!
Think of the children .
Hang him!
Is no one here thinking about the children?
Aah!
Let him hang!
Let him hang!
Put him down!
Enough!
Let him go!
Let him go!
Look around!
Don't you still have enough of death?
Winter is coming for us .
We have to take care of our own .
The sick and the helpless .
Those who can still stand , care for the injured .
And whoever's still strong , follow me .
We have to save as much as we can .
And then?
What do we do then?
To seek refuge .
Hello!
Bombur?
Bifur?
Anyone?
Wait!
Wait!
That's Bilbo!
He's alive!
Stop!
Stop!
Hold it .
You need to get out of here right now .
We all have to get out of here .
We're just getting here .
I tried to talk to him , but he doesn't hear .
- What do you mean , boy?
- Thorin!
Thorin .
Thorin .
He's been down there for days .
He's not sleeping .
He hardly eats anything .
He's not himself anymore .
Not at all .
It's in this place .
A disease seems to lie on him .
Disease?
What kind of illness?
Fili .
Fili!
Fili!
Gold .
Gold beyond all imagination .
Beyond grief and grief .
Look at him , the mighty treasure of Thror .
Welcome to my sister sons . In the kingdom of Erebor .
Balin!
Kili!
Thanks to Durin , you are alive!
Bombur!
You're alive!
Do you have anything?
Nothing yet .
There's nothing here .
Keep looking!
This stone could be anywhere .
The Arkenstein is located in these halls .
- Find him!
You heard's .
- Keep looking .
All of you!
No one rests until he is found .
It almost lures me to let you .
And be it just to see how oak shield suffers .
To see it destroy him .
To see it contaminate his heart . And drive him crazy .
I'll help you .
Just take what's necessary with you .
We have a long march ahead of us .
Where are you going?
There is only one place .
The mountain .
You are magnificent , Lord .
We can seek refuge in the mountain .
Smells a little bit like dragons , but the women make sure clean .
There we have it safe , warm and dry and we have supplies . Beds , clothes and a bit of gold .
The gold in this mountain is cursed .
We only take what we have been promised .
What we need for our new life .
Here .
Do something .
The news of Smaug's death will spread quickly .
Yes .
Others will direct their gaze to the mountain , because of its wealth . And its location .
What do you know?
Nothing .
I fear what may happen .
Waldland-Elben!
The king's son and an elve woman followed us to the seaside town .
You saw something out there .
The ork I tracked in the seaside town , I know who he is .
Bolg , a offspring of Azog , the swindler .
A Warg mute has been waiting for him on the edge of Esgaroth .
They fled to the north .
These orcs were different .
They wore a sign that I haven't seen for a long time .
The sign Gundabads .
Gundabad?
An orc fortress , high in the north of the foggy mountains .
Mr Legolas .
Then tell my father , where there is no place for Tauriel , is also no place for me .
Legolas .
It's your king's order .
Yes , he is my king , but he does not command my heart .
I'm going north . Are you coming with me?
Where?
To Gundabad .
To mortals , eternally forfeited to death , 9 .
I'm not alone .
Do you need help , Mrs . Galadriel?
You should have stayed dead .
Mithrandir , come back .
He's here .
Yes .
The darkness has returned .
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Get on!
He's weak .
He can't stay here .
It consumes his life .
Run!
Quick!
Come with me , Mrs . Galadriel .
Run!
You have no power here , servant of Morgoth .
You're nameless .
Faceless .
Shapeless .
Return to the void from which you once came!
The spirit of Sauron has survived .
But he was expelled .
He will flee . To the East .
Gondor must be warned .
You have to set up guards at Mordor's borders .
No . No .
Take care of Mistress Galadriel .
She's used up a lot of her power .
Their strength is fading .
Take her to Lothlórien .
Mr . Saruman .
He must be destroyed and destroyed once and for all .
Without the Ring of Power , Sauron can never regain control of Middle Earth
Now go .
Leave Sauron to me .
I need a horse .
What?
Gandalf ,
- Where are you going?
- Erebor warn .
They don't know what's ahead of them .
I saw them with my own eyes . Row by row . Moria Orcs .
Gather our friends . Birds and animals .
The battle for the mountain will begin soon .
He's here in these halls .
I know .
We've searched everything .
Not thorough enough .
Thorin , we all wish the stone back .
And yet he's not found yet!
Do you doubt the devotion of anyone here?
The Arkenstein is the birthright of our people .
He's the King's Jewel .
Am I not the king?
Remember:
If anyone finds him and withholds him from me ,
will meet him my revenge .
Dragon disease .
I've seen that before .
That look .
The terrible desire .
It is a wild and envious love , Bilbo .
She has driven his grandfather into delusion .
Balin , if Thorin had the Arkenstein . If ... if he were found ...
This stone is the coronation of everything .
It is the summit of all wealth here . And gives to the power that carries it with it .
Would he stop his madness?
No , my boy .
I'm afraid it would get worse .
Maybe it's better , he remains lost .
What's that?
In your hand .
That , that's nothing .
Show me .
It's ...
I picked them up in Beorn's garden .
You brought her here?
I plant them in my garden .
In sachetsend .
A rather small souvenir for the Auenland .
She's going to be a tree .
And when I look at him , I will remember .
To everything that has happened . The good , the evil . And to happiness , to have made it home .
Thorin , I ...
Thorin .
Survivors from the sea city . They flow into Thal .
Hundreds .
Call everyone to the gate .
To the gate!
Now!
Come on .
- Keep going .
Sir!
Sir!
Up here!
Look , Lord!
The fire shells are burning .
So Thorin oak shield and his entourage survived .
Survived?
You mean there's a bunch of dwarfs in there all over the gold?
Don't worry , Alfrid .
There's enough gold in that mountain for everyone .
Open the night camp here!
Find a shelter .
And make some fires .
Well , then hurry up . Come on .
Alfrid .
You take the night watch .
Get it up!
That's good .
I want the fortress secured by sunrise .
It was difficult to conquer the mountain .
I won't let him take it again .
The people of the sea city have nothing more .
They come to us in need .
Everything they had , they lost .
Don't tell me what you've lost .
Your suffering is well known to me .
Those who have survived the dragon fire , should be happy .
You have every reason to be grateful .
More stones .
Bring more stones to the gate!
We would have .
These children are hungry .
We need something to eat .
We don't last 3 days .
Bard ,
- we don't have enough .
- Do what you can , Peredur .
It's gonna be okay .
Don't be afraid .
We need more water .
Children , injured and women go first .
Here . Drink this .
Good morning , Alfrid .
Something happened at night?
It's all quiet , sir .
Nothing happens .
I don't miss anything .
Except for an army of Elben , as it seems to me .
My Lord Thranduil . We have you here
- not expected .
- I heard you need help .
Here , take it!
Pass it on!
And another one!
You saved us .
I don't know how to thank you .
Your gratitude is unnecessary .
I'm not here for you .
I come to demand back something that belongs to me .
In this mountain there are gemstones that I also desire .
White stones of pure starlight .
The white stones from Lasgal .
I know an Elf Prince who would pay a proud price for it .
Wait!
Please , wait!
You're going to war for a handful of gems?
The heirlooms of my people will not be abandoned lightly .
We have the same goal .
Also my people have a claim to the riches in this mountain .
Let me talk to Thorin .
You want to negotiate with the dwarf?
To prevent a war?
Yes .
For one night no bad work .
Come on .
Greetings , Thorin , son of Thrain .
That you are still alive , we dare not hope .
Why do you come to the king's gate under the mountain in armor?
Why is the king hiding under the mountain like a robber in his cave?
Maybe because I expect to be robbed .
My Lord , to rob you , we are not here . Just for the sake of a just agreement .
Don't you want to talk to me?
I hear .
In the name of the citizens of the maritime city , I ask you to keep your word :
A share of the treasure so that they can rebuild their lives .
I will not negotiate with anyone as long as an army stands in arms at my gate .
This army in weapons will attack the mountain if we do not agree .
Your threats don't impress me .
And your conscience?
Doesn't it tell you that our concern is right?
My people have helped you .
And to thank them you brought nothing but destruction and death .
When have the people from the sea city ever helped , without wanting to be richly rewarded?
We have a deal!
A deal?
What could we do , as our birthright to cover up blankets and food?
As our freedom to buy with our future?
That's what you call a fair trade?
Tell me ,
Bard , the dragon killer , why should I recognize such rules?
Because you gave us your word .
Doesn't that mean anything?
Get out of here!
Before our arrows fly!
What are you doing?
You can't fight a war .
- It's none of your business .
- I'm sorry , but if you haven't noticed , an elbenheer is standing down there in front of the gate .
Not to mention hundreds of angry fishermen .
We're clearly outnumbered .
Not for very long .
What's that supposed to mean?
That means , Master Beutlin , that you should never underestimate dwarfs .
We got the Erebor back .
And now we defend him .
He won't give us anything .
It's a shame .
After all ,
- you tried .
- I don't understand .
Why?
Why does he dare a war?
Negotiating with them is idle .
You only understand the one thing .
We attack at sunrise .
Are you by our side?
Yes .
Master Beutlin , come here .
This could be useful to you .
Put it on .
This shirt was forged in silver steel .
Mithril , that's what my ancestors called it .
No blade can penetrate it .
I look ridiculous .
I'm not a warrior , I'm a Hobbit .
It's a gift .
A sign of our friendship .
True friends are rarely found .
I was blind , but now I see clearly again .
I've been betrayed .
Betrayal?
The Arkenstein .
One of them stole it .
One of them is a fraud .
Thorin ... The task is accomplished . You have the mountain back .
Isn't that enough?
- Betrayed by my own people .
- No , uh ... you made a promise to the people of the seaside town .
Is this treasure really worth more than your honor?
Our honor , Thorin .
I was there .
I , too , have given my word .
And I'm grateful for that .
But the treasure in this mountain does not belong to the people from the sea city .
This gold belongs to us .
We're alone .
In my life , I'm not getting away from a single
Detach the coin .
Not a little bit of it .
Gundabad .
What's behind it?
An old enemy .
The past kingdom Angmar .
This fortress was once the bulwark .
Here were their large armory .
Was their war equipment forged .
A light .
Something has moved .
We are waiting for the protection of the night .
This is a bad place , Tauriel .
In another age our people waged war on this land .
My mother died there .
My father doesn't talk about it .
There is no grave .
No memory .
Nothing .
- Ah!
Let me through!
Get out of the way!
No , no .
No! No!
Hey!
You!
Spit hat!
Yes .
We don't want any rum drivers , beggars , nor vagabonds here .
We have enough troubles without your likes .
Off you go .
Get on your horse .
Who's in charge here?
Who wants to know?
You must settle your petty conflict with the dwarfs .
There will be war!
The Jauchegruben Dol Guldurs pour out .
All of you are in mortal danger .
What are you talking about?
I see you don't know anything about wizards .
They are like a winter storm that rolls on a raging wind , then thundering to bring bad news .
But sometimes a storm is just a storm .
Not this time .
Ork army advance .
They're fighters .
They were bred for the war .
Our enemy has gathered all his forces .
Why would he show up now?
Because we forced him .
Back then , when Thorin Oak Shield left to get his home back .
The dwarfs should never reach the Erebor .
Azog the Shaman was sent to kill her .
His Lord wants to bring the mountain into his control .
Not only because of the treasure , but because of its location . Its strategic position .
This is the gateway to the reconquest of Angmar in the north .
If this dark kingdom rises again , Bruchtal , Lórien , the Auenland , even Gondor will go down .
This orc army , of which you speak , Mithrandir , where are they?
Those fools .
If we want to go in , we should go now .
These bats are bred for a purpose .
For which one?
For war .
Since when has my advice been so underestimated?
What do you think , do I use it?
I think you want to save your dwarf friends and I admire your loyalty to them .
But that won't take me off my course .
You started it , Mithrandir .
Forgive me when I finish it .
Are the archers in position?
Yes , sir .
- Give the order .
If anything moves on this mountain , it kills .
The time of the dwarfs is around .
Archers!
Are you okay with that?
Is gold really so important to you?
Do you buy it with the blood of dwarfs?
It won't come to that .
- They can't win this fight .
That won't stop them .
Do you think the dwarfs surrender?
Never .
They fight to death for their cause .
Bilbo Beutlin .
If I'm not mistaken , this is the halfling who stole the keys to my dungeons in the face of my guards .
Yes .
I beg your pardon .
I came to give you this .
The heart of the mountain .
The King's Jewel .
And royal trigger value .
How do you get into his possession?
That's my fourteenth share of the treasure .
Why are you doing this?
You don't owe us any loyalty .
I'm not doing this for you .
I know , dwarfs can be stubborn and stubborn and difficult .
Mistrustful and secretive and have the worst manners that you can imagine , but they are also brave and kind and infinitely faithful .
I've locked her in the heart and I want to save her if I can .
Thorin is worth this stone more than anything else .
To get him back , he will certainly give you what he owes you .
So there's no reason for war .
Rest tonight .
- You have to leave tomorrow .
- What?
- Get as far away from here as you can .
- I'm not going .
You made me the fourteenth man .
I'm not leaving the venture right now .
There is no undertaking .
Not anymore .
Don't think about what Thorin does when he learns about this .
I'm not afraid of Thorin .
But you should .
Never underestimate evil in gold .
Gold on which a fire-snake has been lying .
The dragon disease penetrates into the hearts of all who come too close to the mountain .
Almost everyone .
Ha .
You there .
Seek this Hobbit a bed and fill his stomach with warm food .
He deserves it .
Hey .
Keep an eye on him .
If he wants to disappear , tell me .
Go on!
Stupid Hobbit .
On , on , Hobbit!
Get out of the feathers!
The next one hits you between your eyes .
We come to tell you that the payment of your debt was offered and accepted .
What payment?
I didn't give you anything .
You have nothing .
We've got this .
You have the Arkenstein .
Thieves!
How does the heirloom of our house come into your hands?
This stone belongs to the king!
And the king shall receive him . With our goodwill .
But first he must stand by his word .
They're trying to fool us .
This is just a trick .
A filthy lie .
The Arkenstein is hidden in this mountain!
It's a delusion!
No , since this is not a deception .
The stone is real .
I gave it to them .
You?
I took it as my fourteenth part .
You stole it from me?
Stolen you?
No . No .
No , may be that I'm a thief , but yet an honest one , I claim .
I'm willing to give up my claims for it .
On your claims?
Your claims .
You have no claims on me , you wretched worm!
I wanted to give it to you already .
- Many times I wanted to , but ...
- But what , you thief?
You've changed , Thorin .
The dwarf I met in Bagsend would never have broken his word .
Never would have doubted the loyalty of his own!
You're not talking to me about loyalty .
Throw him down the wall!
Can't you hear me?
Then I'll do it myself .
No! No!
Cursed shalt thou be , and the sorcerer ,
- who forced you on us!
- If you're not satisfied with my master thief , please don't do anything to him .
Give it back to me .
So far you as king under the mountain do not make a very good figure , don't you? Thorin , son of Thrain .
I don't want anything to do with wizards anymore ...
Now go!
... and auenland rats!
Do we agree?
The return of the Arkenstein against what was promised?
Give us your answer .
Do you want peace or war?
I want war .
Iron foot .
Who's that?
He doesn't look happy .
This is Dain , the Lord of the Iron Mountains .
Thorins
- cousin .
- Are they alike?
To me Thorin was always the more sensible of both .
Good morning .
How are we all doing?
I would have a small suggestion if you would give me a moment of your time .
Would you be so friendly and get out of here!
All of you!
And now!
Hold the position!
Oh , but no , Prince Dain .
Gandalf the Grey .
Tell this rabble to disappear , or I'll water the ground with her blood!
A war between dwarfs , humans and elves is unnecessary .
An army of Orks marches towards the mountain .
Hold your forces back .
I'm not holding anything back from Elves .
And certainly not in front of this devout forestland goblin .
He only wants the worst for my people .
And if he should stand between me and my family ,
Then I'll split his pretty skull!
Let's see if he still smiles so fine .
He's just as insane as his cousin .
Do you hear me , friends?
Here we go!
Let's give the bastards a good rub!
Worms .
There's no way!
The hordes of darkness attack!
Into battle!
Into battle , sons of Durin!
I'm climbing down the wall .
Who's coming with me?
I'm coming with you , brother!
Yes , let's go!
Put down your weapons .
No . No .
Aren't we supposed to do anything?
I said , put down your weapons!
The Elves .
Aren't they going to fight?
Thranduil!
This is insane!
Attack!
Yes!
Uh , Gandalf?
Is it advisable to stand here?
Azog .
He wants to separate us from the others .
Everybody , listen up!
Retreat to Thal!
Now!
To the city!
Bilbo!
This way!
Sigrid!
Tilda!
My children!
Where are my children?
I saw her!
Down at the old market!
At the market?
Where are they now?
Tilda!
Sigrid!
Bard!
Orcs storm over the dam path!
The archers to the eastern chest .
Stop them as long as you can .
Protect!
This way!
The orcs have taken the stone road!
The market is overrun!
Everyone else , follow me!
Attack!
Forward!
To death!
Father!
Father!
Here!
Down here!
Bain!
Sigrid!
Duck!
Listen!
I want you to call all women and children together .
Then you take her to the Great Hall and barricade the gate .
Do you understand?
And will definitely not come out again .
We want to stay with you!
Do you want to obey your father?
Leave it to me , Lord .
You heard him .
- We're going to the Great Hall .
- Alfrid!
Only women and children .
I need every man to fight .
Come back so bad .
I'll take her to safety , sir .
Then I will carry my sword for you .
Get up!
- Take care of her .
March , Mother!
Run into the Great Hall!
Get out of the way!
Leave the cripples behind!
You bastards!
Where's Thorin?
We need him!
Where is he?
Pull back!
Since when do we abandon our own people?
Thorin ... you're dying out there .
There are halls around halls under this mountain .
Places that we can attach , secure , amplify .
Yes . Yes , that's it .
We need to get the gold deeper under the ground
- to be safe .
- Didn't you hear?
Dain is surrounded .
They're being slaughtered .
Many die in war .
A life is worthless .
But a treasure like this cannot be weighed up in lost lives .
It's worth it . Is worth all the blood we shed .
You sit here in these huge halls and wear a crown on your head . But you are a lesser one than you ever were .
Don't talk to me like I'm some insignificant dwarf prince . Like I'm still ...
Thorin
Oak shield .
- I'm your king!
- You've always been my king .
And you used to know that too .
You don't see what has become of you .
Go on .
Get out of here .
Before I kill you .
You sit here and wear a crown on your head .
You're a lesser one than you ever were .
A treasure , like this , can not be weighed up with lost lives .
This treasure is infected by a disease .
For a mountain king blind ambition .
Am I not the king?
This gold belongs to us .
Belongs to us . To us alone .
I will not separate myself from any single coin .
He only has his own advantage in mind .
Like I'm some insignificant dwarf prince .
Thorin Oak Shield .
She drove your grandfather crazy .
This is Thorin , son of Thrain , son of Thror .
I'm not my grandfather .
I'm not my grandfather .
You are the heir of Durin's throne .
They're dying ... dying .
Take the Erebor back .
Dain is surrounded .
Dying .
It's surrounded .
Dying .
Get your home back .
You've changed , Thorin .
I'm not my grandfather .
Is this treasure really worth more than your honor?
I'm not my grandfather .
The treasure will be your death!
Fall back!
Fall back to the mountain!
Fall back!
Now it's coming to an end .
I will not hide behind a wall of stone , while others will drag us into battle!
It's not in my blood , Thorin .
No . No .
Certainly not .
We are sons of Durin .
And Durin's people do not flee from battle .
I have no right to demand this from you ,
but do you want to follow me? One last time?
Thorin .
For the king!
For the king!
The Dwarves .
They're going to fight .
At the side of her king .
Every man who is ready to give everything , follow me!
We stand by our men in life , so also in death .
- I'm coming with you .
Arm yourselves .
- Come with us , Mother .
No , no , no .
- Leave me old woman in peace .
- Don't be afraid .
I said , let me!
Alfrid Leckspuckel .
What a coward you are .
A coward?
Not every man would be brave enough to wear a corset .
You're not a man .
You're a weasel .
There!
Thorin!
Hang in there!
I'm coming!
Hey , cousin!
Where have you been so long?
There are too many of these bastards , Thorin .
I hope you have a plan .
Yes .
We destroy their leader .
Azog?
I'm gonna kill this piece of scum .
Forward!
Maybe we'll survive after all .
Gandalf!
This is Thorin .
And Fili , Kili and Dwalin .
He takes his best warriors with him .
And what are they going to do?
Beat off the snake's head .
Die!
Gandalf!
Legolas .
Legola's green leaf .
A second army is on its way .
Bolg leads Orks from Gundabad .
You'll be here soon .
Gundabad .
That was their plan , from the beginning .
Azog attacks us and then Bolg pushes with his troops from the north .
The North?
Where is the North
- exactly?
- At Rabenberg .
At Rabenberg?
Thorin's up there .
And Fili and Kili .
They're all up there .
Where is he?
Looks abandoned .
I think Azog has fled .
I don't think so .
Fili ... take your brother with you .
Search the towers .
Do not let yourselves be seen and remain in cover .
If you encounter anything , report .
Don't attack .
- Got it?
- We're getting visitors .
Orc mercenaries .
Not more than 100 .
We'll take care of them .
Leave!
Leave!
Come here!
Call your men back .
My lord , send a squad to Rabenberg .
The dwarfs will soon be overrun .
Thorin must be warned .
Please , warn him calmly .
I've shed enough elve blood to defend this damned country .
Thranduil?
I'm going .
Don't be ridiculous .
You'll never make it .
Why not?
Because they'll see you coming and kill you .
They won't .
You won't see me .
That's out of the question .
I won't allow it .
I'm not asking for permission , Gandalf .
You will not continue .
You will not turn away .
Not this time .
Get out of my way .
You will slaughter the dwarfs .
Yes , they will die .
Today , tomorrow , in a year or in 100 years of today .
What does that mean?
You're mortal .
You think your life is worth more than theirs , although there is no love in it .
There is no love in you .
What do you know about love?
Nothing .
What you feel for this dwarf is not real .
You think it's love?
Would you be willing to die for it?
If you do something to her , you'll have to kill me .
I'm coming with you .
Get up .
Get away from me .
I no longer obey you .
People have trusted you .
Have listened to you .
The mayor's cape was at hand and you threw it all away .
For what?
Alfrid ... You can see the underskirt .
No . No .
Stay here .
You look further down .
I can handle this .
Where's this dirty ork?
Thorin .
Bilbo .
You have to get out of here .
Now .
Azog has a second army that attacks from the north .
This watchtower will be surrounded
- and no one escapes .
- We're so close .
That disgusting orc is in there .
Let's get him .
No . No .
That's what he wants .
He wants to lure us in .
This is a trap .
Ah .
Find Fili and Kili .
Call her back .
Thorin , are you sure?
Do it .
We fight another day .
Oh ...
First , this one dies .
Flee .
Run!
Kili!
Thorin .
Thorin .
No . No .
No . No .
Kili .
Kili!
Kili!
Tauriel!
Kili .
No! No!
No! No!
Mm .
Tauriel!
The eagles are coming .
Bilbo .
Don't move .
Don't move .
Lie still .
Oh .
Mm .
Mm .
I'm glad you're here .
- Psst , psst .
- Ah .
I want to divorce you in friendship .
No . No .
You , you're not going anywhere , Thorin .
You'll live .
I want to take back what I said at the gate .
You have done what a true friend does .
Forgive me .
I was too blind to see it .
I'm so sorry I put you in such a danger .
No , I'm glad that I was allowed to go through the dangers with you , Thorin .
I'm happy for each one .
That's much more than any Beutlin gets .
Farewell ,
Master thief .
Return to your books .
And to your chair .
Plant your trees .
Watch them grow .
If there were only more , a home would look higher than gold . This world would be a much happier place .
No . No .
No , no , no .
No . No .
No , Thorin .
Don't you dare .
Thorin .
Thorin .
Thorin , hold on .
Hang in there .
The eagles ...
The eagles ...
The eagles are here .
Thorin?
The A ...
I can't go back .
Where are you going?
I don't know .
Go north .
Find the Dúnedain .
Among them is a young forest runner .
Find him .
His father , Arathorn , was a good man .
His son could once become a great man .
What's his name?
In the wilderness they call it strings .
You'll have to find out his real name yourself .
Legolas .
Your mother loved you .
More than anyone .
More than life .
I want to bury him .
Yes .
If that's love , then I don't want it .
Release me from it .
Please .
Why does she hurt so much?
It was true .
There's a big party tonight .
Songs are sung , stories are told .
And Thorin Eichenschild will become a legend .
I know that you must honor him in this way .
But to me he never was .
He was ...
For me ... he was ..
I'll keep quiet about it .
Do you say goodbye to the others?
Why don't you tell them yourself?
If you come back to Bagsend again , uh ... tea's at 4:00 .
There's enough .
You are welcome at any time .
Uh ...
You don't need to knock .
Ah , the border to the Auenland .
This is where I have to leave you .
Too bad .
It's quite pleasant when you have a wizard with you .
They seem to bring luck .
You don't think you got away with all your adventures with healing skin , was only luck?
Magic rings must not be used lightly , Bilbo .
Don't fool me .
I know you found one in the Orcstollen .
And since then , I've been keeping an eye on you .
Thank heaven .
Farewell , Gandalf .
Farewell .
You need , uh , not to worry about this ring .
He fell out of my pocket at the battle .
I lost him .
You're a very fine guy , Bilbo Beutlin .
And I love you very much .
But you're just a little boy , on the big wide world .
Wait a minute , this is my mother's check-out box .
And this is my chair .
Ah ...
Bring the bench back immediately!
What's going on?
Good afternoon ,
Mr Bilbo .
You shouldn't be here at all .
What do you mean?
Well , because you've been declared dead and everything .
I'm not dead .
Neither explained nor otherwise how .
I don't think that's allowed .
Mr . Bilbo!
19 , 20 . 21?
Who increases to 21?
Ha , ha .
Sold to Mrs . Bolger .
Now Dick's feet finally have a spot .
Do I hear a command for this?
Made in the Auenland .
Not the shameful imitation dwarf stuff .
Stop!
Stop!
- That's a mistake!
Who are you?
Who am I?
You know exactly who I am ,
Lobelia Sackheim-Beutlin .
This is my home!
And these are my spoons .
Thank you very much .
This is highly irregular .
- Excuse me .
It's been more than 13 months since the disappearance .
If you actually do
Bilbo Beutlin and are undeceased , can you prove that?
What?
Well , any document with your name would suffice .
All right .
Good .
The contract to my employment as a ...
As what doesn't matter .
There .
My signature .
Yeah , so , uh ...
It seems to be correct .
Yes .
It seems to me , there is no doubt .
Who is this person who has used your services?
Thorin Oak Shield?
He ...
He was my friend .
No , thank you!
We don't need any more visitors , congratulations or distant relatives .
And what about very old friends?
Gandalf?
Bilbo Beutlin .
My dear Gandalf!
Ha , ha!
Good to see you .
111 years old .
