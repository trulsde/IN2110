# IN2110 - Methods in Language Technology

## Course content
This course gives an in-depth study in basic methods and practical tools for basal language technology (methods for automatic analyzation of language-based data). It covers both rule-based techniques, such as phrase structure grammar, and approximations with a starting point in machine learning, such as vector space semantics and classification. The course will take a look at some applications of methods for issues within language technology such as tagging, parsing and text classification (such as sentiment analysis). The course has a strong practical component, with use of relevant tools and projects with written rapports, among other things, which is needed to qualify for the exam.

## Learning outcome
When you´re done with this course, you´ll:

- have mastered basic techniques for analyzing linguistic data
- have knowledge of vectorspace semantics and its applications
- be able to explain and process phase structure- and dependence grammar
- have insight in basal techniques used for language technological experimentation
- be able to independently finish a project using standard tools
- have training in how to write a scientific summary of a project
- be able to analyse an issue from a interdisciplinary perspective
- be able to combine techniques from computer science, linguistics, machine learning and more
