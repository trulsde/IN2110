The world is changed .
I feel it in the water .
I feel it in the earth .
I smell it in the air .
Much that once was is lost . For none now live who remember it .
It began with the forging of the Great Rings .
Three were given to the Elves : Immortal , wisest and fairest of all beings .
Seven to the Dwarf-lords : Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls .
And nine nine rings were gifted to the race of Men who , above all else , desire power .
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race .
But they were all of them deceived .
For another ring was made .
In the land of Mordor , in the fires of Mount Doom the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others .
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty , his malice and his will to dominate all life .
One Ring to rule them all .
One by one the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring .
But there were some who resisted .
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor .
And on the slopes of Mount Doom , they fought for Middle-earth 's freedom .
Victory was near .
But the power of the Ring could not be undone .
It was in this moment when all hope had faded that Isildur , son of the king , took up his father 's sword .
Sauron , the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth , was defeated .
The Ring passed to Isildur who had this one chance to destroy evil forever .
But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted .
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own .
It betrayed Isildur to his death .
And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost .
History became legend legend became myth .
And for 2500 years the Ring passed out of all knowledge .
Until , when chance came it ensnared a new bearer .
My precious .
The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the Mistу Mountains .
And there it consumed him .
It came to me .
My own .
My love .
My own .
My precious .
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life .
For 500 уears it poisoned his mind .
And in the gloom of Gollum 's cave , it waited .
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world .
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East whispers of a nameless fear .
And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now come .
It abandoned Gollum .
But something happened then the Ring did not intend .
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable .
What 's this ?
A Hobbit .
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire .
A ring .
Lost !
My precious is lost !
For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all .
The Shire ... 60 years later
The road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began Now far ahead the road has gone
- You 're late .
A wizard is never late , Frodo Baggins .
Nor is he early .
He arrives precisely when he means to .
It 's wonderful to see you , Gandalf !
You didn 't think I 'd miss your Uncle Bilbo 's birthday ?
What news of the world ?
Tell me everything .
Everything ?
You 're far too eager and curious for a Hobbit .
Most unnatural .
What can I tell you ?
Life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past Age .
Full of its own comings and goings .
Scarcely aware of the existence of Hobbits .
For which I am very thankful .
Oh , the long-expected party .
How is the old rascal ?
I hear it 'll be a party of special magnificence .
You know Bilbo .
He 's got the place in an uproar .
That should please him .
- Half the Shire 's invited .
- Gracious me .
He 's up to something .
All right , then .
Keep your secrets .
Before you came along , Bagginses were well thought of .
Never had any adventures .
If you 're referring to the dragon incident , I was barely involved .
All I did was give your uncle a nudge out of the door .
Well , you 've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace .
Oh , really ?
FEMALE HOBBIT 1 : Fireworks , Gandalf !
- I 'm glad you 're back .
- So am I , dear boy .
So am I.
No , thank you !
We don 't want any visitors , well-wishers or relations !
And what about very old friends ?
- Bilbo Baggins .
- My dear Gandalf !
Good to see you . 111 years old !
Who would believe it ?
You haven 't aged a day .
Come on , come in !
Welcome , welcome .
Or maybe something stronger ?
I 've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left . 1296 .
Very good year .
Almost as old as I am .
It was laid down by my father .
What say we open one , eh ?
Just tea , thank you .
I expected you last week .
But you come and go as you please . You always have .
I 'm a bit unprepared .
We 've only got cold chicken and pickle ... .
There 's some cheese here .
No , that won 't do .
We 've got raspberry jam , an apple tart ... .
But not much for afters .
Oh , no , we 're all right .
I 've just found some sponge cake .
I could make eggs
- Just tea , thank you .
- Oh , right .
- Mind if I eat ?
- No , not at all .
I 'm not at home !
I must get away from these confounded relatives never giving me any peace .
I want to see mountains again .
Mountains , Gandalf !
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book .
Oh , tea .
- You mean to go through with your plan ?
- Yes .
It 's all in hand .
All the arrangements are made .
Frodo suspects something .
Of course he does .
He 's a Baggins not some blockhead from Hardbottle .
You will tell him , won 't you ?
- He 's very fond of you .
I know .
He 'd probably come with me if I asked him .
In his heart , Frodo 's still in love with the Shire .
The woods , the fields .
Little rivers .
I am old , Gandalf .
I know I don 't look it , but I 'm beginning to feel it in my heart .
I feel thin .
Sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread .
I need a holiday .
A very long holiday .
And I don 't expect I shall return .
In fact , I mean not to .
Old Toby .
The finest weed in the Southfarthing .
Gandalf , my old friend this will be a night to remember .
Welcome , welcome .
Go on , Sam .
Ask Rosie for a dance .
- I 'll just have another ale .
- No , you don 't .
Go on !
So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls .
And they were all arguing about how to cook us . Whether it be turned on a spit or if they should squash us into jelly .
They spent so much time arguing whithertos and whyfors that the sun 's first light crept over the trees and turned them all to stone !
Quickly .
No , the big one .
- It should be in the ground .
- It is in the ground .
- Outside !
Bilbo , watch out for the dragon !
There hasn 't been a dragon here for 1000 years .
- That was good .
- Let 's get another one .
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took .
I might 've known .
Speech , Bilbo !
Speech !
My dear Bagginses and Boffins Tooks and Brandybucks Grubbs , Chubbs Hornblowers Bolgers Bracegirdles ...
- ... and Proudfoots . - Proudfeet !
Today is my 111th birthday !
But alas , 111 years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits .
I don 't know half of you as well as I 'd like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve .
I have things to do .
I 've put this off far too long .
I regret to announce this is the end !
I 'm going now .
I bid you all a very fond farewell .
Goodbye .
I suppose you think that was terribly clever .
Come on , Gandalf .
Did you see their faces ?
There are many magic rings in this world . None should be used lightly .
It was just a bit of fun .
Oh , you 're probably right , as usual .
- You will keep an eye on Frodo ?
- Two eyes .
As often as I can spare them .
- I 'm leaving him everything .
- What about the ring ?
- Is that staying too ?
- Yes , yes .
It 's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece .
Wait , it 's here in my pocket . No .
Isn 't that- - ? Isn 't that odd , now ?
Yet , after all , why not ?
- Why shouldn 't I keep it ?
- You should leave the ring behind .
Is that so hard ?
Well , no .
And yes .
Now it comes , I don 't feel like parting with it . It 's mine .
It came to me !
- There 's no need to get angry .
- If I 'm angry , it 's your fault !
It 's mine .
My own .
- My precious .
- Precious ?
It 's been called that before , but not by you .
What business is it of yours what I do ?
I think you 've had that ring long enough .
- You want it for yourself !
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks .
I am not trying to rob you .
I 'm trying to help you .
All your long years , we 've been friends .
Trust me as you once did .
Let it go .
You 're right , Gandalf .
The ring must go to Frodo .
It 's late .
The road is long .
Yes , it is time .
The ring is still in your pocket .
I 've thought up an ending for my book :
And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days .
And I 'm sure you will , my dear friend .
Goodbye , Gandalf .
Goodbye , dear Bilbo .
Until our next meeting .
It 's mine .
My own .
My precious .
Riddles in the dark .
My precious .
Precious .
He 's gone , hasn 't he ?
He talked for so long about leaving I didn 't think he 'd really do it .
Bilbo 's ring .
He 's gone to stay with the Elves . He 's left you Bag End .
Along with all his possessions .
The ring is yours now .
- Put it somewhere out of sight .
- Where are you going ?
- I must see to things .
- What things ?
- Questions that need answering .
- You 've only just arrived .
I don 't understand .
Neither do I.
Keep it secret .
Keep it safe .
Shire !
Baggins !
The year 3434 of the Second Age .
Here follows the account of Isildur , High King of Gondor and the finding of the Ring of Power .
It has come to me .
The One Ring .
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom .
All those in my line shall be bound to its fate for I will risk no hurt to the Ring .
It is precious to me though I buy it with great pain .
The markings upon the band begin to fade .
The writing , which was as clear as flame , has all but disappeared .
A secret now that only fire can tell .
Shire .
Baggins .
There 's no Bagginses here .
They 're all up in Hobbiton .
That way .
Is it secret ?
Is it safe ?
What are you doing ?
Hold out your hand , Frodo .
It 's quite cool .
What can you see ?
Can you see anything ?
Nothing .
There 's nothing .
Wait .
There are markings .
It 's some form of Elvish .
I can 't read it .
There are few who can .
The language is that of Mordor , which I will not utter here .
In the common tongue , it says :
One Ring to rule them all One Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them .
This is the One Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom .
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself .
Bilbo found it .
- In Gollum 's cave . - Yes .
For 60 years , the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo 's keeping prolonging his life , delaying old age .
But no longer , Frodo .
Evil is stirring in Mordor .
The Ring has awoken .
It 's heard its master 's call .
But he was destroyed .
Sauron was destroyed .
No , Frodo .
The spirit of Sauron endured .
His life force is bound to the Ring , and the Ring survived .
Sauron has returned .
His Orcs have multiplied .
His fortress at Barad-dûr is rebuilt in Mordor .
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness .
He is seeking it .
Seeking it .
All his thought is bent on it .
For the Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master .
They are one the Ring and the Dark Lord .
Frodo he must never find it .
All right .
We put it away .
We keep it hidden . We never speak of it again .
No one knows it 's here , do they ?
Do they , Gandalf ?
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring .
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum .
But the enemy found him first .
I don 't know how long they tortured him .
But amidst the screams and inane babble , they discerned two words :
Shire .
Baggins .
But that would lead them here !
Who goes there ?
Take it , Gandalf !
- Take it ! - No .
- You must !
- You cannot offer me this !
- I 'm giving it to you !
- Don 't tempt me , Frodo !
I dare not take it .
Not even to keep it safe .
Understand , Frodo I would use this Ring from a desire to do good .
But through me , it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine .
- But it cannot stay in the Shire !
No , it can 't .
What must I do ?
- You must leave .
And leave quickly .
- Where do I go ?
Out of the Shire .
The village of Bree .
- What about you ?
- I 'll be waiting for you at the inn of the Prancing Pony .
- And the Ring will be safe there ?
- I don 't know , Frodo .
I don 't have any answers .
I must see the head of my order .
He 's both wise and powerful .
He 'll know what to do .
You 'll have to leave the name Baggins behind .
That name is not safe outside the Shire .
Travel only by day .
And stay off the road .
I can cut across country easily enough .
My dear Frodo .
Hobbits really are amazing creatures .
You can learn all their ways in a month .
And yet , after 100 years they can still surprise you .
Get down .
Confound it all , Samwise Gamgee !
Were you eavesdropping ?
I haven 't been dropping no eaves .
I was cutting grass under the window .
A little late for trimming the verge !
- I heard voices .
- What did you hear ? Speak !
Nothing important .
I heard about a ring , a Dark Lord and the end of the world
Please , Mr. Gandalf , don 't hurt me .
Don 't turn me into anything unnatural .
No ?
Perhaps not .
I 've thought of a better use for you .
Come along , Samwise .
Keep up .
Be careful , both of you .
The enemy has many spies in his service :
Birds , beasts .
Is it safe ?
Never put it on for the Dark Lord 's agents will be drawn to its power .
Always remember the Ring is trying to get back to its master .
It wants to be found .
This is it .
This is what ?
If I take one more step it 'll be the farthest away from home I 've ever been .
Come on , Sam .
Remember what Bilbo said :
- It 's a dangerous business- - BILBO : - - Frodo , going out your door .
You step onto the road , and if you don 't keep your feet there 's no knowing where you might be swept off to .
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom .
The hour grows late .
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel .
For that is why you have come , is it not ?
My old friend .
Saruman .
You are sure of this ?
Beyond any doubt .
So the Ring of Power has been found .
All these long years , it was in the Shire .
- Under my very nose .
- Yet you did not see it .
Your love of the halfling 's leaf has clearly slowed your mind .
But we still have time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly .
Time ?
What time do you think we have ?
Sauron has regained much of his former strength .
He cannot yet take physical form but his spirit has lost none of its potency .
Concealed within his fortress , the Lord of Mordor sees all .
His gaze pierces cloud , shadow , earth and flesh .
You know of what I speak , Gandalf .
A Great Eye , lidless , wreathed in flame .
The Eye of Sauron .
He is gathering all evil to him .
Very soon , he 'll have summoned an army great enough to attack Middle-earth .
You know this ?
How ?
I have seen it .
A palantír is a dangerous tool , Saruman .
Why ? Why should we fear to use it ?
They are not all accounted for , the lost Seeing-stones .
We do not know who else may be watching .
The hour is later than you think .
Sauron 's forces are already moving .
The Nine have left Minas Morgul .
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer 's Eve disguised as riders in black .
- They 've reached the Shire ?
- They will find the Ring .
And kill the one who carries it .
Frodo !
You did not think a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron ?
There are none who can .
Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory .
We must join with him , Gandalf .
We must join with Sauron .
It would be wise , my friend .
Tell me friend when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness ?
I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly but you have elected the way of pain !
- I thought I 'd lost you .
- What are you talking about ?
- It 's something Gandalf said .
- What did he say ?
Don 't you lose him , Samwise Gamgee . And I don 't mean to .
Sam , we 're still in the Shire .
What could possibly happen ?
Merry , it 's Frodo Baggins . - Hello .
Get off him .
What 's the meaning of this ?
You 've been into Farmer Maggot 's crop !
Get out of my field !
I don 't know why he 's upset .
It 's only carrots .
And some cabbages .
And those bags of potatoes we lifted last week .
- And the mushrooms the week before .
Yes , Pippin .
My point is he 's clearly overreacting .
Run !
Oh , that was close .
I think I 've broken something .
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took !
What ?
That was just a detour .
A shortcut .
- Shortcut to what ?
- Mushrooms !
I think we should get off the road .
Get off the road !
Quick !
Be quiet !
What was that ?
Anything ?
Nothing .
What is going on ?
That Black Rider was looking for something .
Or someone .
Get down !
I have to leave the Shire .
Sam and I must get to Bree .
Right .
Bucklebury Ferry .
Follow me .
This way !
Get the rope , Sam !
Run , Frodo !
Come on !
- How far to the nearest crossing ?
- The Brandywine Bridge . 20 miles .
Come on .
- What do you want ?
- We 're heading for the Prancing Pony .
Hobbits .
Four Hobbits !
- What brings you to Bree ?
- We wish to stay at the inn .
Our business is our own .
All right , young sir .
I meant no offense .
It 's my job to ask questions after dark .
There 's talk of strange folk abroad .
Can 't be too careful .
Excuse me .
Good evening , little masters .
If you need accommodation , we got cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available .
Mister ... ?
Underhill .
My name 's Underhill .
- Underhill .
- We 're friends of Gandalf . - Can you tell him we 've arrived ?
Oh , yes I remember .
Big grey beard , pointy hat .
Not seen him for six months .
What do we do now ?
Sam he 'll be here . He 'll come .
What 's that ?
This , my friend , is a pint .
It comes in pints ?
- I 'm getting one .
- You got a half already !
That fellow 's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived .
Excuse me .
That Man in the corner .
Who is he ?
He 's one of them Rangers .
They 're dangerous folk , wandering the Wilds .
I 've never heard his right name , but he 's known as Strider .
Strider .
VOICE OF THE RING : Baggins .
Baggins .
Baggins ?
Sure , I know a Baggins . He 's over there .
Frodo Baggins .
He 's my cousin , once removed on his mother 's side and twice removed ... .
- Steady on .
You cannot hide .
I see you .
There is no life in the void .
Only death .
You draw far too much attention to yourself , Mr. Underhill .
- What do you want ?
- More caution . That 's no trinket .
- I carry nothing .
I can avoid being seen if I wish but to disappear entirely , that is a rare gift .
- Who are you ?
- Are you frightened ?
Yes .
Not nearly frightened enough .
I know what hunts you .
Let him go ! Or I 'll have you , Longshanks .
You have a stout heart , Hobbit .
But that will not save you .
You can no longer wait for the wizard , Frodo .
They 're coming .
What are they ?
They were once Men .
Great kings of Men .
Then Sauron gave to them nine rings of power .
Blinded by greed , they took them without question .
One by one , falling into darkness .
Now they are slaves to his will .
They are the Nazgûl .
Ringwraiths .
Neither living nor dead .
At all times they feel the presence of the Ring drawn to the power of the One .
They will never stop hunting you .
- Where are you taking us ?
- Into the Wild .
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?
We have no choice but to trust him .
- Where is he leading us ?
To Rivendell , Master Gamgee .
- To the house of Elrond .
Did you hear ?
Rivendell .
We 're going to see the Elves .
- We do not stop till nightfall . - What about breakfast ?
- You had it .
- We 've had one , yes .
What about second breakfast ?
Don 't think he knows about second breakfast .
What about elevenses ?
Luncheon ?
Afternoon tea ?
Dinner ?
Supper ?
- He knows about them , doesn 't he ?
- I wouldn 't count on it .
The power of Isengard is at your command Sauron , Lord of the Earth .
Build me an army worthy of Mordor .
What orders from Mordor , my lord ?
What does the Eye command ?
We have work to do .
The trees are strong , my lord .
Their roots go deep .
Rip them all down .
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl .
We shall rest here tonight .
These are for you .
Keep them close .
I 'm going to have a look around .
Stay here .
- What are you doing ? !
- Tomatoes , sausages , crispy bacon .
We saved some for you .
Put it out , fools !
That 's nice ! Ash on my tomatoes !
Go !
Back , you devils !
- Help him , Strider .
- He 's been stabbed by a Morgul blade .
This is beyond my skill to heal .
He needs Elvish medicine .
Hurry !
We 're six days from Rivendell !
Hold on , Frodo .
He 's going cold .
Is he going to die ?
He 's passing into the Shadow World .
He 'll become a Wraith like them .
- They 're close .
- Sam , do you know the Athelas plant ?
- Kingsfoil .
It 's a weed .
It may help slow the poisoning .
What 's this ? A Ranger caught off his guard ?
I am Arwen
- I 've come to help you .
Hear my voice ...
Come back to the light .
Who is she ?
- She 's an Elf .
- He 's fading .
He 's not going to last .
We must get him to my father .
- I 've been looking for you . - Where are you going ?
There are five Wraiths behind you .
I don 't know where the other four are .
Stay with the Hobbits .
I 'll send horses for you .
I 'm the faster rider - I 'll take him .
The Road is too dangerous .
What are they saying ?
If I can get across the river the power of my people will protect him .
I do not fear them .
Arwen ride hard .
What are you doing ? !
Those Wraiths are still out there !
Give up the halfling , She-Elf .
If you want him , come and claim him .
Frodo , no .
Frodo , don 't give in .
Not now .
What grace is given me let it pass to him .
Let him be spared .
Save him .
- Where am I ?
You 're in the house of Elrond .
It 's 10 : 00 in the morning on October 24th , if you want to know .
- Gandalf ! - Yes , I 'm here .
And you 're lucky to be here too .
A few more hours and you 'd have been beyond our aid .
But you have some strength in you , my dear Hobbit .
What happened , Gandalf ?
- Why didn 't you meet us ?
- I am sorry , Frodo .
I was delayed .
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside .
One ill turn deserves another .
It is over .
Embrace the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction !
There is only one Lord of the Ring .
Only one who can bend it to his will .
And he does not share power .
So you have chosen death .
What is it ?
Nothing , Frodo .
- Bless you , you 're awake !
Sam has hardly left your side .
We were that worried about you .
By the skills of Lord Elrond , you 're beginning to mend .
Welcome to Rivendell , Frodo Baggins .
Bilbo ! - Hello , Frodo , my lad .
There and Back Again :
A Hobbit 's Tale , by Bilbo Baggins .
- This is wonderful .
- I meant to go back wonder at the powers of Mirkwood visit Lake-town see the Lonely Mountain again .
But age , it seems , has finally caught up with me .
I miss the Shire .
I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else .
Off with you , on one of your adventures .
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different .
I 'm not like you , Bilbo .
My dear boy .
Now , what have I forgot ?
- Packed already ?
No harm in being prepared .
- But you wanted to see the Elves .
- I do .
- More than anything .
- I did .
It 's just ... .
We did what Gandalf wanted , didn 't we ?
We got the Ring this far , to Rivendell .
And I thought seeing as how you 're on the mend , we 'd be off soon .
Off home .
You 're right , Sam .
We did what we set out to do .
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell .
I am ready to go home .
His strength returns .
That wound will never fully heal .
He will carry it the rest of his life .
To have come so far bearing the Ring he 's shown extraordinary resilience to its evil .
It is a burden he should never have had to bear .
- We can ask no more of Frodo .
- Gandalf , the enemy is moving .
Sauron 's forces are massing in the East .
He 's fixed on Rivendell .
Saruman , you tell me , has betrayed us .
Our list of allies grows thin .
His treachery runs deeper than you know .
Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men .
He 's breeding an army in Isengard .
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed .
Saruman is coming for the Ring .
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves .
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard !
Gandalf the Ring cannot stay here .
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth .
They must decide now how to end it .
The time of the Elves is over .
My people are leaving .
Who will you look to when we 've gone ?
The Dwarves ?
They seek riches .
They care nothing for the troubles of others .
It is in Men that we must place our hope .
Men ?
Men are weak .
The race of Men is failing .
The blood of Númenor is spent , its pride and dignity forgotten .
It is because of Men the Ring survives .
I was there , Gandalf .
I was there 3000 years ago when Isildur took the Ring .
I was there the day the strength of Men failed .
Isildur , hurry !
Follow me .
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom where the Ring was forged and could be destroуed .
Cast it into the fire !
- Destroy it !
It should have ended that day , but evil was allowed to endure .
Isildur kept the Ring .
The line of kings is broken .
There 's no strength left in the world of Men .
- They 're divided , leaderless .
- There 's one who can unite them .
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor .
He turned from that path a long time ago .
He has chosen exile .
The shards of Narsil .
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron 's hand .
It 's still sharp .
But no more than a broken heirloom .
Why do you fear the past ?
You are Isildur 's heir , not Isildur himself .
You are not bound to his fate .
The same blood flows in my veins .
The same weakness .
Your time will come .
You will face the same evil .
And you will defeat it .
The Shadow does not hold sway yet .
Not over you ... not over me .
Do you remember when we first met ?
I thought I had strayed into a dream .
Long years have passed .
You did not have the cares you carry now .
Do you remember what I told you ?
You said you 'd bind yourself to me forsaking the immortal life of your people .
And to that I hold .
I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the Ages of this world alone .
- It is mine to give to whom I will like my heart . I choose a mortal life .
- You cannot give me this .
Strangers from distant lands , friends of old you 've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor .
Middle-earth is on the brink of destruction .
None can escape it .
You will unite , or you will fall .
Each race is bound to this fate , this one doom .
Bring forth the Ring , Frodo .
So it is true .
The doom of Man . - It is a gift .
A gift to the foes of Mordor .
Why not use this Ring ?
Long has my father , the Steward of Gondor kept the forces of Mordor at bay .
By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe .
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy .
Let us use it against him .
You cannot wield it .
None of us can .
The Ring answers to Sauron alone .
It has no other master .
And what would a Ranger know of this matter ?
This is no mere Ranger .
He is Aragorn , son of Arathorn .
You owe him your allegiance .
This is Isildur 's heir ?
And heir to the throne of Gondor .
Sit down , Legolas .
Gondor has no king .
Gondor needs no king .
Aragorn is right .
We cannot use it .
You have only one choice .
The Ring must be destroyed .
What are we waiting for ?
The Ring cannot be destroyed , Gimli , son of Glóin by any craft that we here possess .
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom . Only there can it be unmade .
It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came .
One of you must do this .
One does not simply walk into Mordor .
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs .
There is evil there that does not sleep .
The Great Eye is ever-watchful .
It is a barren wasteland riddled with fire , and ash and dust .
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume .
Not with 10,000 men could you do this .
It is folly .
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said ?
- The Ring must be destroyed .
- And you think you can do it !
And if we fail , what happens when Sauron takes back what is his ?
I 'll be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf !
Never trust an Elf !
Do you not understand ?
While you bicker , Sauron 's power grows !
None can escape it !
You 'll all be destroyed !
I will take it .
I will take the Ring to Mordor .
Though I do not know the way .
I will help you bear this burden , Frodo Baggins as long as it is yours to bear .
If by my life or death I can protect you I will .
You have my sword .
And you have my bow .
And my ax .
You carry the fates of us all , little one .
If this is indeed the will of the Council ... - ... then Gondor will see it done .
- He can 't go without me .
- It 's not possible to separate you even when he 's summoned to a secret Council and you 're not .
We 're coming too !
You 'll have to tie us up to stop us .
You need people of intelligence on this sort of mission .
Quest .
Thing .
Well , that rules you out , Pip .
Nine companions .
So be it .
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring .
Great !
Where are we going ?
My old sword !
Sting .
Here , take it .
- It 's so light .
- Yes .
Made by the Elves , you know .
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close .
It 's times like that , my lad , when you have to be extra careful .
Here 's a pretty thing .
Mithril .
As light as a feather , and as hard as dragon scales .
Let me see you put it on .
My old ring .
I should very much like to hold it again , one last time .
I 'm sorry I brought this upon you , my boy .
I 'm sorry that you must carry this burden .
I 'm sorry for everything .
We hold to this course , west of the Misty Mountains , for 40 days .
If our luck holds , the Gap of Rohan will be open to us .
From there , our road turns east to Mordor .
Two , one , five . Good !
Very good .
Move your feet .
- Good , Pip . - Thanks .
Faster !
If anyone was to ask for my opinion , which they 're not I 'd say we were taking the long way .
We could pass through the Mines of Moria .
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome .
No , I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice .
Get him !
For the Shire !
Hold him down , Merry !
- What is that ?
- It 's just a wisp of cloud .
It 's moving fast .
Against the wind .
- Crebain from Dunland !
- Hide !
- Take cover !
Spies of Saruman .
The passage south is being watched .
We must take the Pass of Caradhras .
It is a strange fate we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing .
Such a little thing .
Give the Ring to Frodo .
As you wish .
I care not .
So , Gandalf , you tried to lead them over Caradhras .
And if that fails , where then will you go ?
If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road ?
There is a fell voice on the air .
It 's Saruman !
He 's trying to bring down the mountain !
We must turn back !
No !
Get off the mountain !
Make for the Gap of Rohan , and take the west road to my city !
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard !
We cannot pass over a mountain .
Let us go under it .
Let us go through the Mines of Moria .
You fear to go into those mines .
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep .
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm :
Shadow and flame .
Let the Ring-bearer decide .
We will go through the mines .
So be it .
The walls of Moria .
Well , let 's see .
Ithildin .
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight .
It reads , The Doors of Durin , Lord of Moria .
- Speak , friend , and enter .
- What do you suppose that means ? Simple .
If you 're a friend , speak the password . The doors will open .
Mines are no place for a pony .
- Even one so brave as Bill .
- Bye-bye , Bill .
Go on , Bill .
Don 't worry , Sam , he knows the way home .
Do not disturb the water .
Oh , it 's useless .
It 's a riddle .
Speak ' friend ' and enter .
What 's the Elvish word for friend ?
Mellon .
Soon , Master Elf , you 'll enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves .
Roaring fires , malt beer , ripe meat off the bone !
This , my friend , is my cousin Balin 's home .
And they call it a mine .
A mine !
This is no mine .
It 's a tomb .
Goblins .
We make for the Gap of Rohan .
We should never have come here .
Now , get out of here .
Get out !
Into the mines !
- Legolas !
Run !
We now have but one choice .
We must face the long dark of Moria .
Be on your guard .
There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world .
Quietly now .
It 's a four-day journey to the other side .
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed .
I have no memory of this place .
Are we lost ?
I think we are .
Gandalf 's thinking .
What ?
I 'm hungry .
- There 's something down there .
- It 's Gollum .
- He 's been following us for three days .
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr ?
- Escaped or was set loose .
He hates and loves the Ring , as he hates and loves himself .
He 'll never be rid of his need for it .
It 's a pity Bilbo didn 't kill him .
It is pity that stayed Bilbo 's hand .
Many that live deserve death .
Some that die deserve life .
Can you give it to them , Frodo ?
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment .
Even the very wise cannot see all ends .
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet , for good or ill before this is over .
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many .
I wish the Ring had never come to me and none of this had happened .
So do all who live to see such times .
That isn 't for them to decide .
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that 's given to us .
There are other forces at work besides the will of evil .
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring . In which case , you also were meant to have it .
And that is an encouraging thought .
It 's that way .
- He 's remembered .
No but the air doesn 't smell so foul down here .
If in doubt , Meriadoc , always follow your nose .
Let me risk a little more light .
Behold the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf .
There 's an eye opener , and no mistake .
Here lies Balin son of Fundin Lord of Moria .
He is dead , then .
It 's as I feared .
We must move on .
We cannot linger .
They have taken the bridge and the second hall .
We have barred the gates but cannot hold them for long .
The ground shakes .
Drums drums in the deep .
We cannot get out .
A Shadow moves in the dark .
We cannot get out .
They are coming .
Fool of a Took !
Throw yourself in next time , and rid us of your stupidity .
Orcs .
Stay close to Gandalf !
They have a cave-troll .
Let them come !
There is one Dwarf in Moria who still draws breath .
I think I 'm getting the hang of this .
Oh , no .
He 's alive .
I 'm all right .
I 'm not hurt .
You should be dead .
That would have skewered a wild boar .
I think there 's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye .
Mithril .
You 're full of surprises , Mr. Baggins .
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm !
What is this new devilry ?
A Balrog .
A demon of the ancient world .
This foe is beyond any of you .
Run !
Quickly !
Lead them on , Aragorn .
The bridge is near .
Do as I say !
Swords are no more use here .
Nobody tosses a Dwarf .
Not the beard !
Steady .
Hold on !
Hang on !
Lean forward !
Steady .
Over the bridge !
Fly !
You cannot pass !
I am a servant of the Secret Fire , wielder of the flame of Anor .
The dark fire will not avail you , flame of Udûn !
Go back to the Shadow .
You shall not pass !
Fly , you fools !
No !
Legolas , get them up .
Give them a moment !
By nightfall , these hills will be swarming with Orcs .
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien .
Come , Boromir .
Legolas . Gimli , get them up .
On your feet , Sam .
Stay close , young Hobbits !
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods .
An Elf-witch of terrible power .
All who look upon her fail under her spell .
And are never seen again .
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom .
You bring great evil here , Ring-bearer .
Well , here 's one Dwarf she won 't ensnare so easily .
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox .
The Dwarf breathes so loud , we could have shot him in the dark .
Haldir of Lorien .
We come here for help .
We need your protection .
Aragorn , these woods are perilous .
We should go back .
You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood .
Come .
She is waiting .
Eight there are here , yet nine there were set out from Rivendell .
Where is Gandalf ?
For I much desire to speak with him .
He has fallen into Shadow .
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife .
Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all .
Yet hope remains while the Company is true .
Do not let your hearts be troubled .
Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil .
Tonight , you will sleep ... .
Welcome , Frodo of the Shire one who has seen the Eye !
A lament for Gandalf .
What do they say about him ?
I have not the heart to tell you .
For me , the grief is still too near .
Take some rest .
These borders are well-protected .
I will find no rest here .
I heard her voice inside my head .
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor .
She said to me , Even now there is hope left .
But I cannot see it .
It is long since we had any hope .
My father is a noble man . But his rule is failing and our people lose faith .
He looks to me to make things right , and I 'd do it .
I would see the glory of Gondor restored .
Have you ever seen it , Aragorn ?
The White Tower of Ecthelion .
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver .
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze .
Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets ?
I have seen the White City long ago .
One day , our paths will lead us there .
And the tower guard shall take up the call :
The Lords of Gondor have returned .
Will you look into the mirror ?
What will I see ?
Even the wisest cannot tell . For the mirror shows many things .
Things that were things that are and some things that have not yet come to pass .
I know what it is you saw .
For it is also in my mind .
It is what will come to pass if you should fail .
The Fellowship is breaking .
It is already begun .
He will try to take the Ring .
You know of whom I speak .
One by one , it will destroy them all .
If you ask it of me I will give you the One Ring .
You offer it to me freely .
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this .
In place of a Dark Lord , you would have a queen not dark but beautiful , and terrible as the dawn !
Treacherous as the sea !
Stronger than the foundations of the earth !
All shall love me and despair .
I pass the test .
I will diminish and go into the West ...
- ... and remain Galadriel .
- I cannot do this alone .
You are a Ring-bearer , Frodo .
To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone .
This task was appointed to you .
And if you do not find a way no one will .
Then I know what I must do .
It 's just I 'm afraid to do it .
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future .
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being ?
They were Elves once . Taken by the Dark Powers tortured and mutilated .
A ruined and terrible form of life .
And now perfected .
My fighting Uruk-hai whom do you serve ?
Saruman !
Hunt them down .
Do not stop until they are found .
You do not know pain . You do not know fear .
You will taste Man-flesh !
One of the halflings has something of great value .
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled .
Kill the others .
I give you the light of Eärendil our most beloved star .
May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out .
The Argonath .
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old .
My kin .
We cross the lake at nightfall . Hide the boats and continue on foot .
- We approach Mordor from the North .
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks .
And after that , it gets even better .
Festering , stinking marshland as far as the eye can see .
That is our road .
Take some rest and recover your strength .
Recover my
- We should leave now .
- No .
Orcs patrol the eastern shore .
We must wait for cover of darkness .
It is not the eastern shore that worries me .
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind .
Something draws near .
I can feel it .
Recover strength ?
Pay no heed to that , young Hobbit .
Where 's Frodo ?
We shouldn 't wander alone .
You , least of all .
So much depends on you .
I know why you seek solitude .
You suffer .
I see it day by day .
You sure you do not suffer needlessly ?
There are other ways , Frodo .
- Other paths we might take .
- I know what you would say .
It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart .
Warning ?
Against what ?
We 're all afraid , Frodo .
But to let that fear drive us , to destroy our hope ... - ... don 't you see that is madness ?
- There is no other way .
I ask only for the strength to defend my people !
- Lend me the Ring .
- No .
- Why do you recoil ? I 'm no thief .
- You 're not yourself .
What chance do you think you have ?
They will find you .
They will take the Ring .
And you will beg for death before the end !
You fool !
It is not yours , save by chance !
It could have been mine .
It should be mine !
Give it to me !
- Give it !
- No .
I see your mind .
You will take the Ring to Sauron !
You will betray us !
You 'll go to your death , the death of us all !
Curse you !
Curse you and all halflings !
What have I done ?
Please , Frodo .
Frodo , I 'm sorry !
- It has taken Boromir .
- Where is the Ring ?
Stay away !
- I swore to protect you .
- Can you protect me from yourself ?
Would you destroy it ?
I would have gone with you to the end .
Into the very fires of Mordor .
I know .
Look after the others .
Especially Sam .
He will not understand .
Go , Frodo !
Run .
Find the halfling !
Aragorn , go !
Hide here . Quick !
Come on !
What 's he doing ?
He 's leaving .
- No !
Run , Frodo .
Hey , you !
- Over here !
- This way !
- It 's working !
- I know ! Run !
- The horn of Gondor .
Run !
- They took the little ones .
- Hold still .
Where is Frodo ?
I let Frodo go .
Then you did what I could not .
I tried to take the Ring from him .
- The Ring is beyond our reach now .
- Forgive me .
I did not see it .
- I have failed you all .
- No , Boromir .
You fought bravely .
You have kept your honor .
Leave it .
It is over .
The world of Men will fall .
And all will come to darkness and my city to ruin .
I don 't know what strength is in my blood but I swear to you , I won 't let the White City fall nor our people fail .
Our people .
I would have followed you , my brother .
My captain .
My king .
Be at peace son of Gondor .
I wish the Ring had never come to me .
I wish none of this had happened .
So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide .
All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you .
Frodo , no !
Frodo ! - No , Sam .
Go back , Sam !
- I 'm going to Mordor alone .
- Of course you are .
And I 'm coming with you !
You can 't swim !
I made a promise , Mr. Frodo .
A promise :
Don 't you leave him , Samwise Gamgee .
And I don 't mean to .
I don 't mean to .
Come on .
Hurry !
Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore .
- You mean not to follow them .
- His fate is no longer in our hands .
Then it has all been in vain .
The Fellowship has failed .
Not if we hold true to each other .
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death .
Not while we have strength left .
Leave all that can be spared behind .
We travel light .
Let us hunt some Orc .
I hope the others find a safer road .
Strider will look after them .
I don 't suppose we 'll ever see them again .
We may yet , Mr. Frodo .
We may .
Sam I 'm glad you 're with me .
You cannot pass !
Gandalf !
I am a servant of the Secret Fire , wielder of the flame of Anor .
Go back to the Shadow .
The dark fire will not avail you , flame of Udûn !
You shall not pass !
No !
No !
Gandalf !
Fly , you fools .
No !
Gandalf !
Gandalf !
What is it , Mr. Frodo ?
Nothing .
Just a dream .
Can you see the bottom ?
No ! Don 't look down , Sam !
Just keep going !
Catch it !
Grab it , Mr. Frodo !
Mr. Frodo !
I think I 've found the bottom .
Bogs and rope , and goodness knows what .
It 's not natural .
None of it .
- What 's in this ?
- Nothing . Just a bit of seasoning .
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something .
Roast chicken ?
You never know .
Sam . My dear Sam .
It 's very special , that .
It 's the best salt in all the Shire .
It is special .
It 's a little bit of home .
We can 't leave this here for someone to follow us down .
Who 's gonna follow us down here , Mr. Frodo ?
It 's a shame , really . Lady Galadriel gave me that .
Real Elvish rope .
Well , there 's nothing for it .
It 's one of my knots .
Won 't come free in a hurry .
Real Elvish rope .
Mordor .
The one place in Middle-earth we don 't want to see any closer .
And it 's the one place we 're trying to get to .
It 's just where we can 't get .
Let 's face it , Mr. Frodo , we 're lost .
I don 't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way .
He didn 't mean for a lot of things to happen , Sam but they did .
Mr. Frodo ?
It 's the Ring , isn 't it ?
It 's getting heavier .
- What food have we got left ?
- Let me see .
Oh , yes . Lovely .
Lembas bread .
And look !
More lembas bread .
I don 't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff , it 's not bad .
Nothing ever dampens your spirits , does it , Sam ?
Those rain clouds might .
This looks strangely familiar .
It 's because we 've been here before .
We 're going in circles .
What is that horrid stink ?
I warrant there 's a nasty bog nearby .
- Can you smell it ?
- Yes . I can smell it .
We 're not alone .
The thieves .
The thieves .
The filthy little thieves .
Where is it ?
They stole it from us .
Curse them , we hates them !
It 's ours , it is , and we wants it !
This is Sting .
You 've seen it before haven 't you , Gollum ?
Release him or I 'll cut your throat .
It burns !
It burns us !
It freezes !
Nasty Elves twisted it .
- Take it off us !
- Quiet , you !
It 's hopeless .
Every Orc in Mordor 's going to hear this racket .
- Let 's just tie him up and leave him . - No !
That would kill us ! Kill us !
It 's no more than you deserve !
Maybe he does deserve to die .
But now that I see him , I do pity him .
We be nice to them if they be nice to us .
Take it off us .
We swears to do what you wants .
We swears .
There 's no promise you can make that I can trust .
We swears to serve the master of the precious .
We will swear on on the precious .
Gollum .
Gollum .
The Ring is treacherous .
It will hold you to your word .
Yes on the precious .
On the precious .
I don 't believe you !
- Get down ! I said , down !
- Sam !
He 's trying to trick us .
If we let him go , he 'll throttle us in our sleep .
- You know the way to Mordor ?
- Yes .
You 've been there before ?
Yes .
You will lead us to the Black Gate .
To the Gate , to the Gate !
To the Gate , the master says .
Yes !
No ! We won 't go back .
Not there .
Not to him .
They can 't make us .
Gollum !
Gollum !
But we swore to serve the master of the precious .
No .
Ashes and dust and thirst there is , and pits , pits , pits .
And Orcses , thousands of Orcses .
And always the Great Eye watching , watching .
Hey ! Come back now !
Come back !
There !
What did I tell you ?
He 's run off , the old villain .
So much for his promises .
This way , Hobbits .
Follow me !
Merry !
Merry !
You 're late .
Our master grows impatient .
He wants the Shire-rats now .
I don 't take orders from Orc-maggots .
Saruman will have his prize .
We will deliver them .
Merry !
Merry ?
Wake up .
My friend is sick .
He needs water .
Please !
Sick , is he ?
Give him some medicine , boys !
Stop it !
Can 't take his draught !
- Leave him alone !
- Why ?
You want some ? Huh ?
Then keep your mouth shut .
Merry .
Hello , Pip .
- You 're hurt .
- I 'm fine .
- It was just an act .
- An act ?
See ?
I fooled you too .
Don 't worry about me , Pippin .
What is it ?
What do you smell ?
Man-flesh .
They 've picked up our trail .
Aragorn .
Let 's move !
Their pace has quickened .
They must have caught our scent .
Hurry !
Come on , Gimli !
Three days and nights pursuit .
No food .
No rest .
And no sign of our quarry , but what bare rock can tell .
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall .
They may yet be alive .
Less than a day ahead of us .
Come .
Come , Gimli !
We 're gaining on them !
I 'm wasted on cross-country .
We Dwarves are natural sprinters .
Very dangerous over short distances .
Rohan .
Home of the Horse-lords .
There 's something strange at work here .
Some evil gives speed to these creatures . Sets its will against us .
Legolas !
What do your Elf-eyes see ?
The Uruks turn northeast .
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard .
Saruman .
The world is changing .
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor ?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers ?
Together , my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth .
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry .
The forests will fall .
A new order will rise .
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc .
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks !
But , my lord , there are too many !
We cannot all be armed in time , we don 't have the means .
Build a dam , block the stream , work the furnaces night and day .
We don 't have enough fuel to feed the fires .
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep .
- Burn it . - Yes .
We will fight for you .
Swear it .
We will die for Saruman .
The Horse-Men took your lands .
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks .
Murderers !
Take back the lands they stole from you .
We have only to remove those who oppose us .
It will begin in Rohan .
Too long have these peasants stood against you .
But no more .
Éothain !
Éothain !
You take your sister .
You 'll go faster with just two .
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf .
He is too big for him .
Listen to me .
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm .
- Do you understand me ?
- Yes , Mama .
I don 't want to leave .
I don 't want to go , Mama .
Freda , I will find you there .
Quickly !
Go , child .
Rohan , my lord is ready to fall .
Théodred .
Find the king 's son !
- Mordor will pay for this .
- These Orcs are not from Mordor .
My Lord Éomer , over here !
He 's alive .
Théodred .
Your son is badly wounded , my lord .
He was ambushed by Orcs .
If we don 't defend our country , Saruman will take it by force .
That is a lie .
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally .
Grima .
Grima .
Grima .
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands . Unchecked . Unchallenged .
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman .
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind ?
Can you not see ?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering .
Warmongering ?
How long is it since Saruman bought you ?
What was the promised price , Grima ?
When all the Men are dead , you will take your share of the treasure ?
Too long have you watched my sister .
Too long have you haunted her steps .
You see much , Éomer , son of Éomund .
Too much .
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death .
You have no authority here .
Your orders mean nothing .
This order does not come from me .
It comes from the king .
He signed it this morning .
Keep breathing .
That 's the key .
Breathe .
They 've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them .
We 're not going no further until we 've had a breather .
Get a fire going !
Merry !
Merry !
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire , Pippin .
What 's making that noise ?
It 's the trees . What ?
You remember the Old Forest , on the borders of Buckland ?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive .
Alive ?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move .
I 'm starving .
We ain 't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days .
Yeah !
Why can 't we have some meat ? !
What about them ?
They 're fresh .
They are not for eating .
What about their legs ?
They don 't need those .
- They look tasty .
Get back , scum !
The prisoners go to Saruman .
Alive and unspoiled .
Alive ?
Why alive ?
Do they give good sport ?
They have something .
An Elvish weapon .
The master wants it for the war .
- They think we have the Ring .
- Shh .
As soon as they find out we don 't , we 're dead .
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank .
Looks like meat 's back on the menu , boys .
Pippin .
Let 's go .
Go on .
Call for help .
Squeal .
No one 's going to save you now .
Pippin !
A red sun rises .
Blood has been spilled this night .
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark ?
What business does an Elf , a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark ?
Speak quickly !
Give me your name , horse-master , and I shall give you mine .
I would cut off your head , Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground .
You would die before your stroke fell .
I am Aragorn , son of Arathorn .
This is Gimli , son of Glóin , and Legolas of the Woodland Realm .
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden , your king .
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe .
Not even his own kin .
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands .
My company are those loyal to Rohan .
And for that , we are banished .
The White Wizard is cunning .
He walks here and there , they say as an old man hooded and cloaked .
And everywhere , his spies slip past our nets .
We are no spies .
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain .
They have taken two of our friends captive .
The Uruks are destroyed .
We slaughtered them during the night .
But there were two Hobbits .
Did you see two Hobbits with them ?
They would be small . Only children to your eyes .
We left none alive .
We piled the carcasses and burned them .
Dead ?
I am sorry .
Hasufel !
Arod !
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters .
Farewell .
Look for your friends .
But do not trust to hope .
It has forsaken these lands .
We ride north !
It 's one of their wee belts .
We failed them .
A Hobbit lay here .
And the other .
They crawled .
Their hands were bound .
Their bonds were cut .
They ran over here .
They were followed .
The belt !
Run !
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest .
Fangorn ?
What madness drove them in there ?
Did we lose him ?
I think we lost him .
I 'm going to rip out your filthy little innards !
Come here !
Trees .
Climb a tree .
He 's gone .
Merry !
Let 's put a maggot hole in your belly !
Run , Merry !
Little Orcs .
It 's talking , Merry .
The tree is talking .
Tree ?
I am no tree !
I am an Ent .
A tree-herder .
A shepherd of the forest .
Don 't talk to it , Merry .
Don 't encourage it !
Treebeard , some call me .
And whose side are you on ?
Side ?
I am on nobody 's side because nobody 's on my side , little Orc .
Nobody cares for the woods anymore .
We 're not Orcs !
We 're Hobbits !
Hobbits ?
Never heard of a Hobbit before .
Sounds like Orc mischief to me !
They come with fire .
They come with axes .
Gnawing , biting , breaking , hacking , burning !
- Destroyers and usurpers !
Curse them ! - No !
You don 't understand .
We 're Hobbits !
Halflings !
Shire-folk !
Maybe you are and maybe you aren 't .
The White Wizard will know .
The White Wizard ?
Saruman .
See ?
See ?
We 've led you out .
Hurry , Hobbitses .
Hurry !
Very lucky we find you .
Nice Hobbit .
Oh !
It 's a bog .
He 's led us into a swamp .
A swamp , yes , yes .
Come , master .
We will take you on safe paths through the mist .
Come , Hobbits !
Come !
We go quickly .
I found it .
I did .
The way through the marshes .
Orcs don 't use it .
Orcs don 't know it .
They go around for miles and miles .
Come quickly .
Soft and quick as shadows we must be .
I hate this place .
It 's too quiet .
There 's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days .
No , no birdses to eat .
No crunchable birdses .
And we are famished ! Yes !
Famished we are , precious !
Here .
What does it eats ?
Is it tasty ?
It tries to chokes us !
We can 't eats Hobbit food !
We must starve !
Well , starve , then .
And good riddance !
Oh , cruel Hobbit .
It does not care if we be hungry .
Does not care if we should die .
Not like master .
Master cares .
Master knows .
Yes .
Precious .
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go .
Don 't touch me !
There are dead things !
Dead faces in the water .
All dead .
All rotten .
Elves and Men and Orcses .
A great battle long ago .
Dead Marshes .
Yes . Yes , that is their name .
This way .
Don 't follow the lights .
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own .
Careful now !
Frodo !
- Gollum ?
- Don 't follow the lights .
Gollum !
- Mr . Frodo !
Are you all right ?
So bright .
So beautiful .
Our precious .
What did you say ?
Master should be resting .
Master needs to keep up his strength .
- Who are you ?
- Mustn 't ask us .
Not its business .
Gollum .
Gollum .
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk .
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story .
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once . Were you ?
Sméagol .
What did you call me ?
That was your name once , wasn 't it ?
A long time ago .
My name .
Sméagol .
Black Riders !
Hide ! Hide !
Come on , Frodo .
Come on !
Quick !
They will see us !
They will see us !
- I thought they were dead .
- Dead ?
No , you cannot kill them .
Wraiths !
Wraiths on wings !
They are calling for it .
They are calling for the precious .
Mr. Frodo ! It 's all right .
I 'm here .
Hurry , Hobbits .
The Black Gate is very close .
Orc blood .
These are strange tracks .
The air is so close in here .
This forest is old .
Very old .
Full of memory and anger .
The trees are speaking to each other .
Gimli !
Lower your ax .
They have feelings , my friend .
The Elves began it .
Waking up the trees , teaching them to speak .
Talking trees .
What do trees have to talk about ?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings .
Something 's out there .
What do you see ?
The White Wizard approaches .
Do not let him speak . He will put a spell on us .
We must be quick .
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits .
Where are they ?
They passed this way the day before yesterday .
They met someone they did not expect .
Does that comfort you ?
Who are you ?
Show yourself !
It cannot be .
Forgive me .
I mistook you for Saruman .
I am Saruman .
Or rather , Saruman as he should have been .
You fell .
Through fire and water .
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth .
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside .
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time .
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth .
But it was not the end .
I felt life in me again .
I 've been sent back until my task is done .
Gandalf .
Gandalf ?
Yes .
That was what they used to call me .
Gandalf the Grey .
That was my name .
Gandalf .
I am Gandalf the White .
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide .
One stage of your journey is over .
Another begins .
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed .
Edoras ?
That is no short distance !
We hear of trouble in Rohan .
It goes ill with the king .
Yes , and it will not be easily cured .
Then we have run all this way for nothing ?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid , dark , dank , tree-infested- - ?
I mean , charming quite charming forest .
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn .
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years .
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains .
In one thing you have not changed , dear friend .
- Hm ?
- You still speak in riddles .
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days .
The Ents are going to wake up ...
- ... and find that they are strong .
- Strong ?
Oh , that 's good .
So stop your fretting , Master Dwarf .
Merry and Pippin are quite safe .
In fact , they are far safer than you are about to be .
This new Gandalf 's more grumpy than the old one .
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell .
Shadowfax .
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers .
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer 's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse .
- Is it much further ?
- Bru-ra-hroom .
Don 't be hasty .
You might call it far , perhaps .
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain .
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe . And safe is where I 'll keep you .
I believe you will enjoy this next one too .
It 's one of my own compositions .
Right .
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Oh .
Sleep , little Shirelings .
Heed no nightly noise .
Sleep till morning light .
I have business in the forest .
There are many to call .
Many that must come .
The Shadow lies on Fangorn .
The withering of all woods is drawing near .
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape .
Sauron will suffer no rival .
From the summit of Barad-dûr , his Eye watches ceaselessly .
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear .
Doubt ever gnaws at him .
The rumor has reached him .
The heir of Númenor still lives .
Sauron fears you , Aragorn .
He fears what you may become .
And so he 'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men .
He will use his puppet , Saruman , to destroy Rohan .
War is coming .
Rohan must defend itself , and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall .
The king 's mind is enslaved , it 's an old device of Saruman 's .
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong .
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose .
But for all their cunning we have one advantage .
The Ring remains hidden .
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams .
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit .
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom .
We must trust now in Frodo .
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest .
Do not regret your decision to leave him .
Frodo must finish this task alone .
He 's not alone .
Sam went with him .
Did he ?
Did he , indeed ?
Good .
Yes , very good .
The Black Gate of Mordor .
Oh , save us .
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now .
Master says to show him the way into Mordor .
So good Sméagol does , master says so .
I did .
That 's it , then .
We can 't get past that .
Look !
The gate .
It 's opening !
I can see a way down .
Sam , no !
Master !
- I do not ask you to come with me , Sam .
- I know , Mr. Frodo .
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there .
- Now !
No !
No ! No , master !
They catch you !
They catch you !
Don 't take it to him .
He wants the precious .
Always he is looking for it .
And the precious is wanting to go back to him .
But we mustn 't let him have it .
No !
There 's another way .
More secret .
A dark way .
- Why haven 't you spoken of this before ?
- Because master did not ask .
He 's up to something .
Are you saying there 's another way into Mordor ?
Yes . There 's a path and some stairs .
And then a tunnel .
He 's led us this far , Sam .
Mr. Frodo , no .
He 's been true to his word .
No .
Lead the way , Sméagol .
Good Sméagol always helps .
Hello ?
Treebeard ?
Where has he gone ?
I had the loveliest dream last night .
There was this large barrel , full of pipe-weed .
And we smoked all of it .
And then you were sick .
I 'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby .
Did you hear that ?
There it is again .
Something 's not right here .
Not right at all .
You just said something ... Treeish .
No , I didn 't .
I was just stretching .
You 're taller .
- Who ?
- You !
- Than what ?
- Than me !
I 've always been taller than you .
Pippin , everyone knows I 'm the tall one . You 're the short one .
Please , Merry .
You 're what ?
Three-foot-six ?
At the most ?
Whereas me , I 'm pushing 3 ' 7 .
3 ' 8 !
Three-foot-eight .
You did something .
Merry , don 't !
Don 't drink it !
Merry !
No , Treebeard said that you shouldn 't have any .
I want some !
- It could well be dangerous !
Give me it back .
Merry !
What 's happening ? !
It 's got my leg !
Merry !
No !
Help !
Away with you .
You should not be waking .
Eat earth .
Dig deep .
Drink water .
Go to sleep .
Away with you .
Come , the forest is waking up .
It isn 't safe .
The trees have grown wild and dangerous .
Anger festers in their hearts .
Black are their thoughts .
Strong is their hate .
They will harm you if they can .
There are too few of us now .
Too few of us Ents left to manage them .
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long ?
- Are there Ent children ?
- Bru-ra-hroom .
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years .
- Why is that ?
- We lost the Entwives .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
- How did they die ?
- Die ?
No .
We lost them .
And now we cannot find them .
I don 't suppose you 've seen Entwives in the Shire ?
Can 't say that I have .
You , Pip ?
What do they look like ?
I don 't remember now .
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld .
There dwells Théoden , King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown .
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong .
My lord , your son he is dead .
My lord ?
Uncle ?
Will you not go to him ?
Will you do nothing ?
Be careful what you say .
Do not look for welcome here .
Oh , he must have died sometime in the night .
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir .
I understand . His passing is hard to accept .
Especially now that your brother has deserted you .
Leave me alone , snake !
Oh , but you are alone .
Who knows what you 've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink .
The walls of your bower closing in about you . A hutch to trammel some wild thing in .
So fair . So cold .
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter 's chill .
Your words are poison .
You 'll find more cheer in a graveyard .
Ah .
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed , Gandalf Greyhame .
By order of Grima Wormtongue .
- Your staff .
- Hm ?
Oh ... .
You would not part an old man from his walking stick .
My lord , Gandalf the Grey is coming .
He 's a herald of woe .
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King .
He 's not welcome .
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow ?
A just question , my liege .
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear .
Láthspell I name him .
Ill news is an ill guest .
Be silent .
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth .
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm .
His staff .
I told you to take the wizard 's staff .
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows .
I would stay still if I were you .
Hearken to me !
I release you from the spell .
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey .
I will draw you , Saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
Wait .
If I go , Théoden dies .
You did not kill me you will not kill him .
Rohan is mine .
Be gone .
I know your face .
Éowyn .
Éowyn .
Gandalf ?
Breathe the free air again , my friend .
Dark have been my dreams of late .
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword .
I 've only ever served you , my lord .
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast !
Send me not from your sight .
No , my lord ! No , my lord .
Let him go .
Enough blood has been spilt on his account .
Get out of my way !
Hail , Théoden King !
Where is Théodred ?
Where is my son ?
Simbelmynë .
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers .
Now it shall cover the grave of my son .
Alas that these evil days should be mine .
The young perish and the old linger .
That I should live to see the last days of my house .
Théodred 's death was not of your making .
No parent should have to bury their child .
He was strong in life .
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers .
They had no warning . They were unarmed .
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold , burning as they go .
Rick , cot and tree .
- Where is Mama ?
Shh .
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash .
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron .
Ride out and meet him head on .
Draw him away from your women and children .
You must fight .
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak .
Éomer is loyal to you .
His men will return and fight for their king .
They will be 300 leagues from here by now .
Éomer cannot help us .
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people .
I will not risk open war .
Open war is upon you , whether you would risk it or not .
When last I looked Théoden , not Aragorn , was king of Rohan .
Then what is the king 's decision ?
By order of the king the city must empty . HÁ
We make for the refuge of Helm 's Deep .
Do not burden yourself with treasures .
Take only what provisions you need .
Helm 's Deep .
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight .
Who will defend them if not their king ?
He 's only doing what he thinks is best for his people .
Helm 's Deep has saved them in the past .
There is no way out of that ravine .
Théoden is walking into a trap .
He thinks he 's leading them to safety .
What they will get is a massacre .
Théoden has a strong will , but I fear for him .
I fear for the survival of Rohan .
He will need you before the end , Aragorn .
The people of Rohan will need you .
The defenses have to hold .
They will hold .
The Grey Pilgrim . That 's what they used to call me .
Three hundred lives of Men I 've walked this earth , and now I have no time .
With luck , my search will not be in vain .
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day .
At dawn , look to the east .
Go .
That horse is half mad , my lord . There 's nothing you can do .
Leave him .
His name is Brego .
He was my cousin 's horse .
Brego .
Your name is kingly .
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North .
You speak as one of their own .
I was raised in Rivendell for a time .
Turn this fellow free .
He 's seen enough of war .
Gandalf the White .
Gandalf the Fool !
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety ?
There were three who followed the wizard .
An Elf , a Dwarf and a Man .
You stink of horse .
The Man ...
- ... was he from Gondor ?
- No , from the North .
One of the Dúnedain Rangers , I thought he was .
His cloth was poor .
And yet he bore a strange ring .
Two serpents with emerald eyes .
One devouring , the other crowned with golden flowers .
The Ring of Barahir .
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur 's heir .
The lost king of Gondor .
He is a fool .
The line was broken years ago .
It matters not .
The world of Men shall fall .
It will begin at Edoras .
I am ready , Gamling .
Bring my horse .
This is not a defeat .
We will return .
We will return .
You have some skill with a blade .
Women of this country learned long ago : Those without swords can still die upon them .
I fear neither death nor pain .
What do you fear , my lady ?
A cage .
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them . And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
You 're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan .
I do not think that would be your fate .
Théoden will not stay at Edoras .
It 's vulnerable .
He knows this .
He will expect an attack on the city .
They will flee to Helm 's Deep the great fortress of Rohan .
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains .
They will be slow .
They will have women and children with them .
Send out your Warg-riders .
Hey , stinker , don 't go getting too far ahead .
- Why do you do that ?
- What ?
Call him names .
Run him down all the time .
Because .
Because that 's what he is , Mr. Frodo .
There 's naught left in him but lies and deceit .
It 's the Ring he wants .
It 's all he cares about .
You have no idea what it did to him what it 's still doing to him .
I want to help him , Sam .
Why ?
Because I have to believe he can come back .
You can 't save him , Mr. Frodo .
What do you know about it ?
Nothing !
I 'm sorry , Sam .
I don 't know why I said that .
I do .
It 's the Ring .
You can 't take your eyes off it .
I 've seen you .
You 're not eating .
You barely sleep .
It 's taken hold of you , Mr. Frodo .
- You have to fight it . - I know what I have to do , Sam .
The Ring was entrusted to me .
It 's my task .
Mine !
My own !
Can 't you hear yourself ?
Don 't you know who you sound like ?
We wants it .
We needs it .
Must have the precious .
They stole it from us .
Sneaky little Hobbitses .
Wicked .
Tricksy .
False .
No .
Not master .
Yes , precious .
False .
They will cheat you , hurt you , lie !
Master 's my friend .
You don 't have any friends .
Nobody likes you .
Not listening .
I 'm not listening .
You 're a liar and a thief .
No .
Murderer .
Go away .
Go away ?
I hate you .
Where would you be without me ?
Gollum .
Gollum .
I saved us .
It was me .
We survived because of me .
Not anymore .
What did you say ?
Master looks after us now .
We don 't need you .
What ?
Leave now and never come back .
No .
Leave now and never come back .
Leave now and never come back !
We told him to go away .
And away he goes , precious .
Gone !
Gone !
Gone !
Sméagol is free !
Look .
Look .
See what Sméagol finds ?
They are young .
They are tender .
They are nice .
Yes , they are .
Eat them .
Eat them !
You 'll make him sick , you will behaving like that .
There 's only one way to eat a brace of coneys .
What 's it doing ?
Stupid , fat Hobbit .
It ruins it .
What 's to ruin ?
There 's hardly any meat on them .
What we need is a few good taters .
What 's taters , precious ?
What 's taters ?
Eh ?
Po-ta-toes .
Boil them , mash them , stick them in a stew .
Lovely , big , golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish .
Even you couldn 't say no to that .
Oh , yes , we could .
Spoil a nice fish .
Give it to us raw and wriggling .
You keep nasty chips .
You 're hopeless .
Mr. Frodo ?
Who are they ?
Wicked Men .
Servants of Sauron .
They are called to Mordor .
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him .
It won 't be long now .
He will soon be ready .
- Ready to do what ?
- To make his war .
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow .
We 've got to get moving .
Come on , Sam .
Mr. Frodo .
Look .
It 's an oliphaunt .
No one at home will believe this .
Sméagol ?
We 've lingered here too long .
Come on , Sam .
No !
Wait !
We 're innocent travelers !
There are no travelers in this land .
Only servants of the Dark Tower .
We are bound to an errand of secrecy .
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us .
The enemy ?
His sense of duty was no less than yours , I deem .
You wonder what his name is where he came from .
And if he was really evil at heart .
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home .
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace .
War will make corpses of us all .
Bind their hands .
It 's true , you don 't see many Dwarf women .
And in fact , they are so alike in voice and appearance that they 're often mistaken for Dwarf men .
It 's the beards .
This , in turn , has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is , of course , ridiculous .
It 's all right .
Nobody panic .
That was deliberate .
It was deliberate .
I haven 't seen my niece smile for a long time .
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead . Cut down by Orcs .
She watched her mother succumb to grief .
Then she was left alone , to tend her king in growing fear .
Doomed to wait upon an old man , who should have loved her as a father .
Gimli .
No , I couldn 't .
I really couldn 't .
I made some stew .
It isn 't much , but it 's hot .
Thank you .
- It 's good .
- Really ?
My uncle told me a strange thing .
He said that you rode to war with Thengel , my grandfather .
But he must be mistaken .
King Théoden has a good memory .
He was only a small child at the time .
Then you must be at least 60 .
Seventy ?
But you cannot be 80 !
Eighty-seven .
You are one of the Dúnedain .
A descendant of Númenor , blessed with long life .
It was said that your race had passed into legend .
There are few of us left .
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago .
I 'm sorry .
Please , eat .
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane .
It is mine to give to whom I will .
Like my heart .
Go to sleep .
I am asleep .
This is a dream .
Then it is a good dream .
Sleep .
You told me once ... this day would come .
This is not the end ... it is the beginning .
You must go with Frodo .
That is your path .
My path is hidden from me .
It is already laid before your feet .
You cannot falter now .
Arwen ... . If you trust nothing else ... trust this ... trust us .
Where is she ?
The woman who gave you that jewel .
Our time here is ending .
Arwen 's time is ending .
Let her go .
Let her take the ship into the west .
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands . There it will be ever green .
But never more than memory .
I will not leave my daughter here to die .
- She stays because she still has hope .
- She stays for you .
She belongs with her people .
Is this how you would take your leave ?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed ?
I will not be coming back .
You underestimate your skill in battle .
You will come back .
It is not of death in battle that I speak .
What do you speak of ?
You have a chance for another life ... away from war ... grief ... despair .
Why are you saying this ?
I am mortal .
You are Elf-kind .
It was a dream , Arwen .
Nothing more .
I don 't believe you .
This belongs to you .
It was a gift .
Keep it .
My lord ?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin .
What is it ?
- Háma ?
- I 'm not sure .
Wargs !
A scout !
- What is it ? What do you see ?
- Warg !
We 're under attack !
All riders to the head of the column .
Come on . Get me up here .
I 'm a rider .
Come on !
You must lead the people to Helm 's Deep , and make haste .
- I can fight .
- No !
You must do this , for me .
Follow me !
Hyah !
Forward .
I mean , charge forward .
ÉOWYN : Make for the lower ground !
- That 's it !
Go on !
- Stay together !
Bring your pretty face to my ax .
That one counts as mine !
Stinking creature .
Aragorn !
Aragorn ?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing .
He 's dead .
He took a little tumble off the cliff .
You lie .
Get the wounded on horses .
The wolves of Isengard will return .
Leave the dead .
Come .
WOMAN 1 : At last !
There it is , Helm 's Deep .
WOMAN 4 : We 're safe !
We 're safe , my lady . Thank you .
Mama !
Éothain !
Freda !
- Where is the rest ?
- This is all we could save , my lady .
Take it to the caves .
Make way for the king .
Make way for Théoden .
Make way for the king .
So few .
So few of you have returned .
Our people are safe .
We have paid for it with many lives .
My lady .
Lord Aragorn where is he ?
He fell .
Draw all our forces behind the wall .
Bar the gate .
And set a watch on the surround .
What of those who cannot fight , my lord ?
The women and children ?
Get them into the caves .
Saruman 's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here .
Helm 's Deep has one weakness .
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain .
How ?
How can fire undo stone ?
What kind of device could bring down the wall ?
If the wall is breached , Helm 's Deep will fall .
Even if it is breached , it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands , to storm the Keep .
Tens of thousands .
But , my lord , there is no such force .
A new power is rising .
Its victory is at hand .
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan !
March to Helm 's Deep !
Leave none alive !
To war !
There will be no dawn for Men .
Look .
There 's smoke to the south .
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days .
Isengard ? TREEBEARD : There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods .
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels .
He no longer cares for growing things .
What is it ?
It 's Saruman 's army .
The war has started .
May the grace of the Valar protect you .
Brego .
Arwen .
It is time .
The ships are leaving for Valinor .
Go now ... before it is too late .
I have made my choice .
He is not coming back .
Why do you linger here when there is no hope ?
There is still hope .
If Aragorn survives this war , you will still be parted .
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality .
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die .
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing .
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world .
But you , my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star .
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent .
Arwen .
There is nothing for you here only death .
Do I not also have your love ?
You have my love , father .
The power of the enemy is growing .
Sauron will use his puppet , Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan .
Isengard has been unleashed .
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men .
His war on this country will come swiftly .
He senses the Ring is close .
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing .
In his heart , Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life .
You know this .
You have foreseen it .
It is the risk we all took .
In the gathering dark , the will of the Ring grows strong .
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men . Men , who are so easily seduced by its power .
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own , and the world will fall .
It is close now . So close to achieving its goal .
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto the ending of the world .
The time of the Elves is over .
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate ?
Do we let them stand alone ?
What news ?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan .
Théoden 's people have fled to Helm 's Deep .
But we must look to our own borders .
Faramir , Orcs are on the move .
Sauron is marshaling an army .
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate .
- How many ?
- Some thousands .
More come every day .
- Who 's covering the river to the north ?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath .
If their city is attacked , we won 't hold it .
Saruman attacks from Isengard .
Sauron from Mordor .
The fight will come to Men on both fronts .
Gondor is weak .
Sauron will strike us soon .
And he will strike hard .
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him .
My men tell me that you are Orc spies .
Spies ?
Now wait just a minute .
Well , if you 're not spies , then who are you ?
Speak .
We are Hobbits of the Shire .
Frodo Baggins is my name , and this is Samwise Gamgee .
Your bodyguard ?
His gardener .
And where is your skulking friend ?
That gangrel creature .
He had an ill-favored look .
There was no other .
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions .
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also .
And an Elf and two Men .
Aragorn , son of Arathorn , and Boromir of Gondor .
You 're a friend of Boromir ?
Yes .
For my part .
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead .
Dead ?
How ?
When ?
As one of his companions , I 'd hoped you would tell me .
If something has happened to Boromir , we would have you tell us .
His horn washed up upon the riverbank , about six days past .
It was cloven in two .
But more than this , I know it in my heart .
He was my brother .
Boromir !
Boromir !
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom .
A place of light and beauty and music .
And so it shall be once more !
Let the armies of Mordor know this :
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands .
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor !
- For Gondor !
- For Gondor !
Good speech .
Nice and short .
Leaves more time for drinking !
Break out the ale !
These men are thirsty !
Remember today , little brother .
Today , life is good .
What ?
He 's here .
- Moment of peace , can he not give us that ?
Where is Gondor 's finest ?
Where 's my first-born ?
Father !
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly .
They exaggerate .
The victory belongs to Faramir also .
But for Faramir , this city would still be standing .
Were you not entrusted to protect it ?
I would have done , but our numbers were too few .
Oh , too few .
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim .
Always you cast a poor reflection on me .
That is not my intent .
You give him no credit , and yet he tries to do your will .
- He loves you , Father .
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses , and they are few .
We have more urgent things to speak of .
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting .
He will not say why , but I have guessed its purpose .
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found .
The One Ring .
- Isildur 's Bane .
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves .
Everyone will try to claim it :
Men , Dwarves , wizards .
We cannot let that happen .
This thing must come to Gondor .
- Gondor .
- It 's dangerous , I know .
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men .
But you , you are strong .
And our need is great .
It is our blood which is being spilled , our people who are dying .
Sauron is biding his time .
He 's massing fresh armies .
He will return .
And when he does , we will be powerless to stop him .
You must go .
Bring me back this mighty gift .
No .
My place is here with my people .
Not in Rivendell .
- Would you deny your own father ?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell ...
- ... send me in his stead .
- You ?
Oh , I see .
A chance for Faramir , captain of Gondor , to show his quality .
I think not .
I trust this mission only to your brother .
The one who will not fail me .
Remember today , little brother .
Captain Faramir !
We found the third one .
You must come with me .
Now .
Down there .
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death .
They wait for my command .
Shall I shoot ?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait .
This creature is bound to me .
And I to him .
He is our guide .
Please let me go down to him .
Sméagol .
Master is here .
Come , Sméagol .
Trust master .
Come .
We must go now ?
Sméagol , you must trust master .
Follow me .
Come on .
Come .
Come , Sméagol .
Nice Sméagol .
That 's it .
Come on .
Don 't hurt him !
Sméagol , don 't struggle .
Sméagol , listen to me .
Master !
That 's enough .
Where are you leading them ?
Answer me .
Sméagol .
Why does it cry , Sméagol ?
Cruel Men hurts us .
Master tricksed us .
Of course he did .
I told you he was tricksy .
I told you he was false .
Master is our friend .
Our friend .
Master betrayed us .
No .
Not its business .
Leave us alone !
Filthy little Hobbitses !
They stole it from us !
No .
No .
What did they steal ?
My precious !
We have to get out of here .
You go .
Go , now .
You can do it .
Use the Ring , Mr. Frodo .
Just this once .
Put it on .
Disappear .
I can 't .
You were right , Sam .
You tried to tell me but ... .
I 'm sorry .
The Ring 's taking me , Sam .
If I put it on he 'll find me .
He 'll see .
Mr. Frodo ... .
So this is the answer to all the riddles .
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call .
The Ring of Power within my grasp .
A chance for Faramir , captain of Gondor to show his quality .
No !
Stop it !
Leave him alone .
Don 't you understand ?
He 's got to destroy it !
That 's where we 're going , into Mordor .
To the Mountain of Fire !
Osgiliath is under attack .
They call for reinforcements .
Please .
It 's such a burden .
Will you not help him ?
Captain ?
Prepare to leave .
The Ring will go to Gondor .
He 's alive !
Where is he ?
Get out of the way !
I 'm going to kill him !
You are the luckiest , the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew .
Bless you , laddie .
Gimli , where is the king ?
You 're late .
You look terrible .
A great host , you say ?
All Isengard is emptied .
How many ?
Ten thousand strong at least .
Ten thousand ?
It is an army bred for a single purpose :
To destroy the world of Men .
They will be here by nightfall .
Let them come !
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall .
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above .
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg !
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs .
These are Uruk-hai .
Their armour is thick and their shields broad .
I have fought many wars , Master Dwarf .
I know how to defend my own keep .
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock .
Saruman 's hordes will pillage and burn . We 've seen it before .
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt .
Within these walls we will outlast them .
They do not come to destroy Rohan 's crops or villages .
They come to destroy its people down to the last child .
What would you have me do ?
Look at my men .
Their courage hangs by a thread .
If this is to be our end , then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance .
Send out riders , my lord .
You must call for aid .
And who will come ?
Elves ?
Dwarves ?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you .
The old alliances are dead .
- Gondor will answer .
- Gondor ? !
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell ? !
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us ? !
Where was Gon- - ?
No , my Lord Aragorn we are alone .
Get the women and children into the caves .
We need more time to lay provisions- - THÉ
There is no time .
War is upon us .
Secure the gate .
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time .
But now , something is about to happen that has not happened for an age .
Entmoot .
What 's that ?
'Tis a gathering .
A gathering of what ?
Beech .
Oak .
Chestnut .
Ash .
Good .
Good .
Good .
Many have come .
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war .
Move to the caves !
Come on , people !
Quickly , now !
We 'll place the reserves along the wall .
They can support the archers from above the gate .
Aragorn , you must rest .
You 're no use to us half alive .
Aragorn !
I 'm to be sent with the women into the caves .
That is an honorable charge .
To mind the children , to find food and bedding when the men return .
What renown is there in that ?
My lady , a time may come for valor without renown .
Who then will your people look to in the last defense ?
- Let me stand at your side .
- It is not in my power to command it .
You do not command the others to stay !
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you .
Because they love you .
I 'm sorry .
Farmers , farriers , stable boys .
These are no soldiers .
- Most have seen too many winters .
- Or too few .
Look at them .
They 're frightened .
I can see it in their eyes .
And they should be ...
Three hundred ... against ten thousand !
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras ...
Aragorn .
They cannot win this fight .
They are all going to die !
Then I shall die as one of them !
Let him go , lad .
Let him be .
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury .
My lord ?
Who am I , Gamling ?
You are our king , sire .
And do you trust your king ?
Your men , my lord will follow you to whatever end .
To whatever end .
Where is the horse and the rider ?
Where is the horn that was blowing ?
They have passed like rain on the mountains .
Like wind in the meadow .
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow .
How did it come to this ?
Huh ?
It 's been going for hours .
They must have decided something by now .
Decided ?
No .
We only just finished saying good morning .
But it 's nighttime already .
You can 't take forever .
Don 't be hasty .
We 're running out of time !
Move to the outer wall .
Give me your sword .
What is your name ?
Haleth , son of Háma , my lord .
The men are saying that we will not live out the night .
They say that it is hopeless .
This is a good sword .
Haleth , son of Háma there is always hope .
We have trusted you this far .
You have not led us astray .
Forgive me .
I was wrong to despair .
There is nothing to forgive , Legolas .
We had time , I 'd get this adjusted .
It 's a little tight across the chest .
That is no Orc horn .
Send for the king .
- Open the gate !
Open up the gate !
How is this possible ?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell .
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men .
Long ago we fought and died together .
We come to honor that allegiance .
You are most welcome .
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more .
You could have picked a better spot .
Well , lad , whatever luck you live by , let 's hope it lasts the night .
Your friends are with you , Aragorn .
Let 's hope they last the night .
Show them no mercy ... for you shall receive none !
- What 's happening out there ?
- Shall I describe it to you ?
Or would you like me to find you a box ?
HOLD !
So it begins .
Prepare to fire !
Their armour is weak at the neck ... and beneath the arm .
Release Arrows !
Did they hit anything ?
Give them a volley .
- Fire !
- Fire !
Send them to me !
Come on !
Ladders !
Good !
Swords !
Swords !
Legolas !
Two already !
I 'm on 17 !
I 'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me !
Nineteen !
Merry .
We have just agreed .
Yes ?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs .
Well , that 's good news .
And what about Saruman ?
Have you come to a decision about him ?
Now , don 't be hasty , Master Meriadoc .
Hasty ?
Our friends are out there .
They need our help .
They cannot fight this war on their own .
War ?
Yes .
It affects us all .
Tree , root and twig .
But you must understand , young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say .
Seventeen !
Eighteen !
Nineteen !
Twenty !
Twenty-one !
Causeway !
Is this it ?
Is this all you can conjure , Saruman ?
Bring him down , Legolas !
Kill him !
Brace the gate !
Hold them !
Stand firm !
Aragorn !
Gimli !
Charge !
The Ents cannot hold back this storm .
We must weather such things as we have always done .
How can that be your decision ? !
This is not our war .
But you 're part of this world !
Aren 't you ? !
You must help .
Please .
You must do something .
You are young and brave , Master Merry .
But your part in this tale is over .
Go back to your home .
Maybe Treebeard 's right .
We don 't belong here , Merry .
It 's too big for us .
What can we do in the end ?
We 've got the Shire .
Maybe we should go home .
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn .
And ... .
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone .
There won 't be a Shire , Pippin .
Aragorn !
Fall back to the Keep !
Get your men out of there !
To the Keep !
Pull back to the Keep !
Haldir !
To the Keep !
What are you doing ?
What are you stopping for ?
Haldir !
Brace the gate !
Hold them !
To the gate .
Draw your swords !
Make way !
We cannot hold much longer !
Hold them !
- How long do you need ?
As long as you can give me .
Gimli !
Timbers !
Brace the gate !
Come on .
We can take them .
It 's a long way .
Toss me .
- What ?
- I cannot jump the distance !
You 'll have to toss me !
Don 't tell the Elf .
Not a word .
Shore up the door !
Make way !
Follow me to the barricade .
Watch our backs !
Throw another one over here !
- Higher !
Hold fast the gate !
Gimli !
Aragorn !
Get out of there !
Aragorn !
Pull everybody back .
Pull them back .
Fall back !
They have broken through !
The castle is breached .
Retreat !
Fall back !
Retreat !
Hurry !
Inside .
Get them inside !
Into the Keep !
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest .
You can make your way north to your homeland from there .
Wait !
Stop !
Stop !
Turn around .
- Turn around .
Take us south .
- South ?
But that will lead you past Isengard .
Yes .
Exactly .
If we go south , we can slip past Saruman unnoticed .
The closer we are to danger , the farther we are from harm .
It 's the last thing he 'll expect .
That doesn 't make sense to me .
But then you are very small .
Perhaps you 're right .
South it is , then .
Hold on , little Shirelings .
I always like going south .
Somehow it feels like going downhill .
Are you mad ?
We 'll be caught .
No , we won 't .
Not this time .
Look !
Osgiliath burns !
Mordor has come .
The Ring will not save Gondor .
It has only the power to destroy .
Please let me go .
Hurry .
Faramir !
You must let me go !
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes , and they tickle me awfully .
They 're always trying to get somewhere where they ... .
Many of these trees were my friends .
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn .
I 'm sorry , Treebeard .
They had voices of their own .
Saruman .
A wizard should know better !
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery .
Look !
The trees !
They 're moving !
Where are they going ?
They have business with the Orcs .
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone .
Yes .
Come , my friends .
The Ents are going to war .
It is likely that we go to our doom .
Last march of the Ents .
Faramir ! Orcs have taken the eastern shore .
Their numbers are too great .
By nightfall we will be overrun .
Mr. Frodo ?
It 's calling to him , Sam .
His Eye is almost on me .
Hold on , Mr. Frodo .
You 'll be all right .
Take them to my father .
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift .
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war .
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir ?
You want to know why your brother died ?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him !
He tried to kill him !
The Ring drove your brother mad !
Watch out !
Mr. Frodo ?
They 're here .
They 've come .
Nazgûl !
Stay here .
Keep out of sight .
Take cover !
The fortress is taken .
It is over .
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it .
They still defend it .
They have died defending it .
They 're breaking in !
They 're past the door !
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves ?
Is there no other way ?
There is one passage .
It leads into the mountains .
But they will not get far .
The Uruk-hai are too many .
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass .
- And barricade the entrance !
- So much death .
What can Men do against such reckless hate ?
Ride out with me .
Ride out and meet them .
For death and glory .
For Rohan .
For your people .
The sun is rising .
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day .
At dawn look to the east .
Yes .
Yes .
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time .
Yes !
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together .
Fell deeds , awake .
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn .
Forth Eorlingas !
Gandalf .
Théoden King stands alone .
Not alone .
Rohirrim !
Éomer .
To the king !
Yes !
A hit .
A fine hit .
Break the dam !
Release the river !
Pippin !
Hold on !
Hold on , little Hobbits .
What are you doing ?
Where are you going ?
It 's me .
It 's your Sam .
Don 't you know your Sam ?
I can 't do this , Sam .
I know .
It 's all wrong .
By rights , we shouldn 't even be here .
But we are .
It 's like in the great stories , Mr. Frodo .
The ones that really mattered .
Full of darkness and danger they were .
And sometimes you didn 't want to know the end because how could the end be happy ?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened ?
Victory !
We have victory !
Even darkness must pass .
A new day will come .
And when the sun shines , it will shine out the clearer .
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something .
Even if you were too small to understand why .
But I think , Mr. Frodo , I do understand .
I know now .
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back , only they didn 't .
They kept going because they were holding on to something .
What are we holding on to , Sam ?
That there 's some good in this world , Mr. Frodo .
And it 's worth fighting for .
I think at last we understand one another , Frodo Baggins .
You know the laws of our country , the laws of your father .
If you let them go , your life will be forfeit .
Then it is forfeit .
Release them .
Stay out of the forest !
Keep away from the trees !
Final count ...
- ... 42 . - Forty-two ?
Oh , that 's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling .
I myself am sitting pretty on 43 .
- Forty-three .
- He was already dead .
- He was twitching .
- He was twitching because he 's got my ax embedded in his nervous system !
He doesn 't look happy , does he ?
Not too happy at all , Merry .
Still , I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there .
Oh , yes .
It 's a quality establishment .
I hear the staff are very good .
- What are you doing ?
- Nothing .
- The world 's back to normal , that 's all .
- No , it isn 't .
I 'm starving .
Good luck trying to find something decent around here .
Probably dead rats and moldy bread .
Saruman 's storeroom !
I don 't believe it .
It can 't be .
- It is !
- Longbottom Leaf .
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing .
It 's perfect .
One barrel each .
Wait .
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard ? Share it ?
No .
No .
Dead plant and all that .
Don 't think he 'd understand .
Could be a distant relative .
I get it .
Don 't be hasty .
Exactly .
Bar-hrum .
This is the old sewer .
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city .
You 'll find cover in the woods there .
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality , sir .
The very highest .
The Shire must truly be a great realm , Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor .
What road will you take once you reach the woods ?
Gollum says there 's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains .
Cirith Ungol ?
- Is that its name ? - No .
No !
- Yes .
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul .
- You cannot go that way .
It is the only way .
Master says we must go to Mordor , so we must try .
I must .
Go , Frodo .
Go with the goodwill of all Men .
Thank you .
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm .
Come on , keep up .
Mr. Frodo didn 't mean for them Rangers to hurt you .
You know that , don 't you ?
He was trying to save you , see ?
Save me ?
So there 's no hard feelings .
- Forgive and forget .
- No , no , no hard feelings .
Gollum , Gollum .
Nice master .
- Nice Hobbits .
Very decent of you .
Very decent , indeed , Gollum .
Sauron 's wrath will be terrible , his retribution swift .
The battle for Helm 's Deep is over .
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin .
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness .
I wonder if we 'll ever be put into songs or tales .
What ?
I wonder if people will ever say , Let 's hear about Frodo and the Ring .
And they 'll say , Yes !
That 's one of my favorite stories .
Frodo was really courageous , wasn 't he , Dad ?
Yes , my boy .
The most famousest of Hobbits .
And that 's saying a lot .
Well , you 've left out one of the chief characters :
Samwise the Brave .
I want to hear more about Sam .
Frodo wouldn 't have got far without Sam .
Now , Mr. Frodo , you shouldn 't make fun .
I was being serious .
So was I.
Samwise the Brave .
Sméagol ?
We 're not going to wait for you .
Come on .
Master .
Master looks after us .
Master wouldn 't hurt us .
Master broke his promise .
Don 't ask Sméagol .
Poor , poor Sméagol .
Master betrayed us .
Wicked .
Tricksy .
False .
We ought to wring his filthy little neck .
Kill him !
Kill him !
Kill them both !
And then we take the precious and we be the master !
But the fat Hobbit , he knows .
Eyes always watching .
Then we stabs them out .
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl .
Yes . Yes . Yes .
Kill them both .
Yes .
No ! No !
It 's too risky . It 's too risky .
Where is he ?
Where has he gone ?
- Hey , Gollum !
Where are you ?
Sméagol ?
We could let her do it .
Yes . She could do it .
Yes , precious , she could .
And then we takes it once they 're dead .
Once they 're dead . Shh .
Come on , Hobbits .
Long ways to go yet .
Sméagol will show you the way .
Follow me .
The Lord of the Rings
Sméagol !
I 've got one !
I 've got a fish , Sméagol . Sméagol !
Pull it in . Go on . Go on .
Deagol !
Deagol !
Deagol !
Give us that , Deagol , my love .
Why ?
Because it 's my birthday and I wants it .
My precious
They cursed us .
Murderer they called us .
They cursed us and drove us away .
Gollum . Gollum . Gollum .
And we wept , precious .
We wept to be so alone .
and cool . So nice for feet .
And we only wish to catch a fish . So juicy sweet .
And we forgot the taste of bread the sound of trees the softness of the wind .
We even forgot our own name .
My precious .
Wake up !
Wake up , sleepies
We must go , yes .
We must go at once .
Haven 't you had any sleep , Mr. Frodo ?
I 've gone and had too much .
Must be getting late . No .
It isn 't .
It isn 't midday yet .
The days are growing darker .
Come on !
Must go !
No time !
Not before Mr. Frodo 's had something to eat .
No time to lose , silly .
Here .
What about you ?
Oh , no , I 'm not hungry .
Leastways , not for lembas bread .
Sam .
All right .
We don 't have that much left .
We have to be careful or we 're going to run out .
You go ahead and eat that , Mr. Frodo .
I 've rationed it .
There should be enough .
For what ?
The journey home .
Come , Hobbitses .
Very close now .
Very close to Mortor .
No safe places here .
Hurry .
I feel like I 'm back at The Green Dragon after a hard day 's work .
Only , you 've never done a hard day 's work .
Welcome , my lords to Isengard !
You young rascals !
We are sitting on a field of victory enjoying a few well-earned comforts .
The salted pork is particularly good .
Salted pork ?
We 're under orders from Treebeard who 's taken over management of Isengard .
Young Master Gandalf .
I 'm glad you 've come .
Wood and water , stock and stone I can master .
But there is a wizard to manage here locked in his tower .
And there Saruman must remain under your guard , Treebeard .
Well , let 's just have his head and be done with it .
No .
He has no power anymore .
The filth of Saruman is washing away .
Trees will come back to live here .
Young trees .
Wild trees . Pippin !
Bless my bark !
Peregrin Took !
I 'll take that , my lad .
Quickly , now .
Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country .
Hail the victorious dead .
Hail !
I am happy for you .
He is an honourable man .
You are both honourable men .
It was not Théoden of Rohan who led our people to victory .
Don 't listen to me .
You are young .
And tonight is for you .
Oh , you can search far and wide you can drink the whole town dry .
But you 'll never find a beer so brown . As the one we drink in our hometown .
You can drink you fancy ales . You can drink 'em by the flagon .
But the only brew for the brave and true .
Comes from The Green Dragon .
Thank you ! I win !
No news of Frodo ?
No word .
Nothing .
We have time .
Every day , Frodo moves closer to Mordor .
Do we know that ?
What does your heart tell you ?
That Frodo is alive .
Yes .
yes , he 's alive .
Too risky .
Too risky .
Thieves .
They stole it from us .
Kill them . Kill them .
Kill them both .
Quiet !
Mustn 't wake them .
Mustn 't ruin it now .
But they knows . They knows .
They suspects us .
What 's it saying , my precious , my love ?
Is Sméagol losing his nerve ?
No .
Not
Never .
Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses .
Sméagol wants to see them dead .
And we will .
Sméagol did it once .
He can do it again .
It 's ours !
Ours !
We must get the precious . We must get it back .
Patience !
Patience , my love .
First we must lead them to her .
We lead them to the Winding Stair .
Yes , the stairs .
And then ?
Up , up , up , up , up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel .
And when they go in there 's no coming out .
She 's always hungry .
She always needs to feed .
She must eat .
All she gets is filthy Orcses .
And they doesn 't taste very nice , does they , precious ?
No .
Not very nice at all , my love .
She hungers for sweeter meats .
Hobbit meat .
And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes then we will find it .
And take it for me !
For us .
Yes . We meant for us .
Gollum .
Gollum .
The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead !
You treacherous little toad !
No !
Master !
No , Sam !
Leave him alone !
I heard it from his own mouth . He means to murder us .
Never !
Sméagol wouldn 't hurt a fly .
He 's a horrid , fat Hobbit ... who hates Sméagol and who makes up nasty lies .
You miserable little maggot !
I 'll stove your head in !
Sam .
Call me a liar ? You 're a liar !
You scare him off , we 're lost !
I don 't care ! I can 't do it , Mr. Frodo .
I won 't wait around for him to kill us !
I 'm not sending him away .
You don 't see it , do you ?
He 's a villain .
We can 't do this by ourselves , Sam .
Not without a guide .
I need you on my side .
I 'm on your side , Mr. Frodo .
I know , Sam .
I know .
Trust me .
Come , Sméagol .
The stars are veiled .
Something stirs in the east .
A sleepless malice .
The Eye of the enemy is moving .
What are you doing ?
Pippin !
Pippin ?
Pippin .
What , are you mad ?
I just want to look at it .
Just one more time .
Put it back .
Pippin .
No !
Pippin .
He is here .
I see you .
Pippin !
Help !
Gandalf , help !
Someone help him !
Pippin !
Fool of a Took !
Look at me .
Gandalf , forgive me .
Look at me .
What did you see ?
A tree .
There was a white tree In a courtyard of stone .
It was dead .
The city was burning .
Minas Tirith ?
Is that what you saw ?
I saw ...
I saw him .
I could hear his voice in my head .
And what did you tell him ?
Speak !
He asked me my name .
I didn 't answer .
He hurt me .
What did you tell him. about Frodo and the Ring ?
There was no lie in Pippin 's eyes .
A fool but an honest fool he remains .
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring .
We 've been strangely fortunate
Pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy 's plan .
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith .
His defeat at Helm 's Deep showed our enemy one thing .
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth . Men are not as weak as he supposed .
There is courage still , strength enough perhaps to challenge him .
Sauron fears this .
He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner .
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a king return to the throne of Men .
If the beacons of Gondor are lit , Rohan must be ready for war .
Tell me why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours ?
What do we owe Condor ?
I will go . No .
They must be warned .
They will be .
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road .
Follow the river and look to the black ships .
Understand this :
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone .
I ride for Minas Tirith and I won 't be going alone .
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits , Peregrin Took , you are the worst .
Hurry ! Hurry !
Where are we going ?
Why did you look ?
Why do you always have to look ?
I don 't know .
I can 't help it .
You never can .
I 'm sorry , all right ?
I won 't do it again .
Don 't you understand ?
The enemy thinks you have the Ring .
He 's going to be looking for you , Pip .
They have to get you out of here .
And you ? You 're coming with me ?
Merry ?
Come on .
How far is Minas Tirith ?
Three days ' ride , as the Nazgûl flies .
And you better hope we don 't have one of those on our tail .
Here .
Something for the road .
The last of the Longbottom Leaf .
I know you 've run out . You smoke too much , Pippin .
But ...
But well see each other soon .
Won 't we ?
I don 't know .
I don 't know what 's going to happen Merry .
Run , Shadowfax .
Show us the meaning of haste .
Merry .
Merry .
Take her by the safest road .
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens .
It waits to carry her across the sea . The last journey of Arwen Undomiel .
There is nothing for you here only death .
Lady Arwen we cannot delay .
My lady !
Tell me what you have seen . Arwen .
You have the gift of foresight .
What did you see ?
I looked into your future , and I saw death .
But there is also life .
You saw there was a child .
You saw my son .
That future is almost gone .
But it is not lost .
Nothing is certain .
Some things are certain .
If I leave him now I will regret it forever .
It is time .
From the ashes a fire shall be woken . A light from the shadow shall spring .
Renewed shall be blade that was broken .
The crownless again shall be king .
Re-forge the sword .
Your hands are cold .
The life of the Eldar is leaving you .
This was my choice .
Whether by your will or not there is no ship now that can bear me hence .
We 've just passed into the realm of Gondor .
Minas Tirith .
City of kings .
Make way !
It 's the tree .
GandaIf . GandaIf .
Yes , the White Tree of Gondor .
The tree of the king .
Lord Denethor , however , is not king .
He is a steward only , a caretaker of the throne .
Now listen carefully .
Lord Denethor is Boromir 's father .
To give him news of his beloved son 's death would be most unwise .
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring .
And say nothing of Aragorn either .
In fact , it 's better if you don 't speak at all , Peregrin Took .
Hail Denethor , son of Ecthelion , lord and steward of Gondor .
I come with tidings in this dark hour , and with counsel .
Perhaps you come to explain this .
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead .
Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me .
He fell defending us from many foes .
Pippin .
I offer you my service , such as it is in payment of this debt .
Get up .
My lord , there will be a time to grieve for Boromir ... but it is not now .
War is corning .
The enemy is on your doorstep .
As steward , you are charged with the defense of this city .
Where are Gondor 's armies ?
You still have friends .
You are not alone in this fight .
Send word to Théoden of Rohan .
Light the beacons .
You think you are wise , Mithrandir .
Yet for all your subtleties , you have not wisdom .
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind ?
I have seen more than you know .
With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor .
And with your right you 'd seek to supplant me .
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan .
Oh , yes .
Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn , son of Arathorn .
And I tell you now , I will not bow to this Ranger from the North last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship .
Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king , steward .
The rule of Condor is mine and no other 's .
Come .
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position .
I mean , they don 't actually expect me to do any fighting .
Do they ?
You 're in the service of the steward now .
You 're going to have to do as you 're told ,
Peregrin Took , guard of the Citadel .
It 's so quiet
It 's the deep breath before the plunge .
I don 't want to be in a battle but waiting on the edge of one I can 't escape is even worse .
Is there any hope , Gandalf , for Frodo and Sam ?
There never was much hope .
Just a fool 's hope .
Our enemy is ready .
His full strength 's gathered .
Not only Ores , but Men as well .
Legions of Haradrim from the south mercenaries from the coast .
All will answer Mordor 's call . Come on .
This will be the end of Condor as we know it .
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest .
If the river is taken , if the garrison at Osgiliath falls the last defense of this city will be gone .
But we have the White Wizard .
That 's got to count for something .
Gandalf ?
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant the one who will lead Mordoris armies in war .
The one they say no living man can kill .
The Witch-king of Angmar .
You 've met him before .
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop .
He is the lord of the Nazgûl the greatest of the Nine .
Minas Morgul is his lair .
The Dead City .
Very nasty place .
Full of enemies .
Quick .
Quick .
They will see .
Come away . Come away .
Look , we have found it .
The way into Mordor .
The secret stair .
Climb .
No , Mr. Frodo !
Not that way !
What 's it doing ? No .
They 're calling me .
Hide ' Hide !
I can feel his blade .
We come to it at last . The great battle of our time .
Come away , Hobbits . We climb .
We must climb .
The board is set .
The pieces are moving .
Peregrin Took , my lad , there is a task now to be done .
Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth .
You must not fail me .
Quiet .
To the river . Quick .
Quick .
Go . Come on .
Faster .
Draw swords .
Amon Din .
The beacon .
The beacon of Amon Din is lit .
Hope is kindled .
The beacons of Minas Tirith !
The beacons are lit !
Condor calls for aid .
And Rohan will answer .
Muster the Rohirrim
Assemble the army at Dunharrow .
As many men as can be found .
You have two days .
On the third , we ride for Condor and war .
Gamling My lord .
Make haste across the Riddermark .
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow . I will .
Will you ride with us ?
Just to the encampment .
It 's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men .
The men have found their captain .
They will follow you into battle , even to death .
You have given us hope .
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith the doom of our time will be decided .
Now is the hour .
Riders of Rohan , oaths you have taken .
Now , fulfill them all .
To lord and land !
Faramir !
We can 't hold them .
The city is lost .
Tell the men to break cover .
We ride for Minas Tirith .
Nazgûl .
Take cover !
Fall back .
Fall back to Minas Tirith !
Retreat !
Retreat !
The age of Men is over .
The time of the Orc has come .
The White Rider !
Pull !
Mithrandir .
They broke through our defenses .
They 've taken the bridge and the west bank .
Battalions of Ores are crossing the river .
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted .
Long has he foreseen this doom .
Foreseen and done nothing .
Faramir ?
This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path .
No .
You 've seen Frodo and Sam ? Where ?
When ?
In Ithilien .
Not two days ago .
Gandalf , they 're taking the road to the Morgul Vale .
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol .
What does that mean ?
What 's wrong ?
Faramir , tell me everything .
Careful , master . Careful .
Very far to fall .
Very dangerous are the stairs .
Come , master .
Come to Sméagol .
Mr. Frodo .
Get back , you !
Don 't touch him !
Why does he hates poor Sméagol ?
What has Sméagol ever done to him ?
Master ?
Master carries heavy burden .
Sméagol knows .
Heavy , heavy burden .
Fat one cannot know .
Sméagol look after master .
He needs it .
He needs it .
Sméagol sees it in his eye .
Very soon he will ask you for it .
You will see .
The fat one will take it from you .
Send forth all legions .
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken .
Slay them all .
What of the wizard ?
I will break him .
What of Théoden 's riders ?
Will Rohan 's army come ?
Mithrandir .
Courage is the best defense that you have now .
Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor In peace or war in living or dying from ...
From this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me .
And I shall not forget it nor fail to reward that which is given
Fealty with love .
Valour with honour .
Disloyalty with vengeance .
I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses ... .. defenses that your brother long held intact .
What would you have me do ?
I will not yield ... he river in Pelennor unfought .
Osgiliath must be retaken .
My lord , Osgiliath is overrun .
Much must be risked in war .
Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord 's will ?
You wish now that our places had been exchanged that I had died and Boromir had lived .
Yes . I wish that .
Since you were robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead .
If I should return , think better of me , Father .
That will depend on the manner of your return .
What are you up to ?
Sneaking off , are we ? Sneaking ?
Sneaking ?
Fat Hobbit is always so polite .
Sméagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say sneak .
sneak ?
Very nice friend . Oh , yes , my precious .
Very nice , very nice .
All right . All right !
You just startled me is all .
What were you doing ?
Sneaking .
Fine .
Have it your own way .
I 'm sorry to wake you Mr. Frodo .
We have to be moving on .
It 's dark still .
It 's always dark here .
It 's gone !
The Elven bread .
What ?
That 's all we have left .
He took it .
He must have !
Sméagol ?
No , no , not poor Sméagol .
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread .
You 're a lying wretch !
What did you do with it ?
He doesn 't eat it .
He can 't have taken it . Look .
What 's this ?
Crumbs on his jacketses .
He took it !
He took it .
I seen him .
He 's always stuffing his face when master 's not looking .
That 's a filthy lie !
You stinking , two-faced sneak !
Sam ! Call me .
Stop it ! Sam !
I 'II kill him !
Sam ! No !
Oh , my .. I 'm sorry .
I didn 't mean it to go so far .
I was just so .. So angry .
Here , just ... Let 's just rest a bit .
I 'm all right . No .
No , you 're not all right . You 're exhausted .
It 's that Gollum .
It 's this place .
It 's that thing around your neck .
I could help a bit .
I could carry it for a while .
Carry it for a while .
Share the load ... Share the load ... the load ... the load . Get away !
I don 't want to keep it .
I just want to help .
See ? See ?
He wants it for himself .
Shut up , you !
Go away ! Get out of here !
No . Sam . It 's you !
I 'm sorry , Sam .
But he 's a liar .
He 's poisoned you against me .
You can 't help me anymore .
You don 't mean that .
Go home .
Faramir !
Faramir !
Your father 's will has turned to madness .
Do not throw away your life so rashly .
Where does my allegiance lie if not here ?
Your father loves you , Faramir .
He will remember it before the end .
Can you sing , Master Hobbit ?
Well Yes .
At least , well enough for my own people .
But we have no songs for great halls and evil times .
And why should your songs .
Come , sing me a song .
Home is behind . The world ahead .
And there are many paths to tread .
Through shadow . To the edge of night .
Until the stars are all alight .
Mist and shadow . Cloud and shade .
All shall fade . All shall .
Fade .
March ! March !
March !
Make way for the king .
My lord .
Hail to you , sire .
Grimbold , how many ?
I bring 500 men from the Westfold , my lord .
We have 300 more from Fenmarch , Théoden King .
Where are the riders from Snowbourn ?
None have come , my lord .
Six thousand spears .
Less than half of what I 'd hoped for .
Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor .
More will come .
Every hour lost hastens Gondor 's defeat .
We have till dawn , then we must ride .
The horses are restless and the men are quiet .
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain .
That road there where does that lead ?
It is the road to the Dimholt , the door under the mountain .
None who venture there ever return .
That mountain is evil .
Aragorn .
Lets find some food .
There .
A true esquire of Rohan .
I 'm ready .
Sorry .
It isn 't all that dangerous .
It 's not even sharp .
Well , that 's no good .
You won 't kill many Ores with a blunt blade .
Come on .
To the smithy .
Go !
You should not encourage him .
You should not doubt him .
I do not doubt his heart , only the reach of his arm .
Why should Merry be left behind ?
He has as much cause to go to war as you .
Why can he not fight for those he loves ?
I choose a mortal life .
I wish I could 've seen him one last time .
Sir ?
King Théoden awaits you , my lord .
I take my leave .
My lord Elrond .
I come on behalf of one whom I love .
Arwen is dying .
She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor .
The light of the Evenstar is failing .
As Sauron 's power grows , her strength wanes .
Arwen 's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring .
The Shadow is upon us . Aragorn .
The end has come .
It will not be our end , but his .
You ride to war , but not to victory .
Sauron 's armies march on Minas Tirith , this you know .
But in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river .
A fleet of Corsairs ships sails from the south .
They 'll be in the city in two days .
You 're outnumbered , Aragorn .
You need more men .
There are none .
There are those who dwell in the mountain .
Murderers traitors .
You would call upon them to fight ?
They believe in nothing .
They answer to no one .
They will answer to the king of Gondor .
Anduril , the Flame of the West , forged from the shards of Narsil .
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil .
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith .
The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth .
Put aside the Ranger .
Become who you were born to be .
Take the Dimholt road .
I give hope to Men .
I keep none for myself .
Why are you doing this ?
The war lies to the east .
You cannot leave on the eve of battle .
You cannot abandon the men .
Eowyn ...
We need you here .
Why have you come ?
Do you not know ?
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love .
I cannot give you what you seek .
Just where do you think. you 're off to ?
Not this time . This time you must stay , Gimli .
Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves ?
You might as well accept it .
We 're going with you , laddie .
What 's happening ? Where is he going ?
Where 's he going ?
I don 't understand .
Lord Aragorn !
Why does he leave on the eve of battle ?
He leaves because there is no hope .
He leaves because he must .
Too few have come .
We cannot defeat. the armies of Mordor .
No ... we cannot .
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless .
I have left instruction .
The people are to follow your rule in my stead .
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall .
Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill .
What other duty would you have me do , my lord ?
Duty ?
No .
I would have you smile again not grieve for those whose time has come .
You shall live to see these days renewed and no more despair .
What kind of army would linger in such a place ?
One that is cursed .
Long ago , the Men of the Mountains swore an oath to the last king of Gondor to come to his aid to fight .
But when the time came when Condor 's need was dire they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain .
And so Isildur cursed them never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge .
The very warmth of my blood seems stole away .
The way is shut .
It was made by those who are dead .
And the Dead keep it .
The way is shut .
Brego !
I do not fear death .
Well , this is a thing unheard-of .
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not ?
Oh , I 'd never hear the end of it .
We must ride light and swift .
It is a long road ahead .
And man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight .
Little Hobbits do not belong in war , Master Meriadoc .
All my friends have gone to battle .
I would be ashamed to be left behind .
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith .
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden .
I want to fight .
I will say no more .
Ride with me .
My lady .
Form up ! Move out ! Form up !
Move out !
Ride !
Ride now to Condor !
Who enters my domain ?
One who will have your allegiance .
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass .
You will suffer me .
The way is shut .
It was made by those who are dead .
And the Dead keep it .
The way is shut .
Now you must die .
I summon you to fulfill your oath .
None but the king of Gondor may command me .
That line was broken .
It has been remade .
Fight for us and regain your honour .
What say you ?
What say you ?
You waste your time , Aragorn .
They had no honour in life , they have none now in death .
I am Isildur 's heir .
Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled .
What say you ?
Open the gate !
Quick !
Quick !
Hurry !
Faramir !
Say not that he has fallen .
They were outnumbered .
None survived .
Fear .
The city is rank with it .
Let us ease their pain .
Release the prisoners .
Catapults !
My sons are spent .
My line has ended .
He 's alive !
The House of Stewards has failed .
He needs medicine , my lord .
My line has ended !
My lord !
Rohan has deserted us .
Théoden 's betrayed me .
Abandon your posts !
Flee !
Flee for your lives !
Prepare for battle !
Hurry , men !
To the wall !
Defend the wall !
Return to your posts !
Send these foul beasts into the abyss .
Stay where you are .
We need more rubble !
Watch out !
Down to the lower level .
Quick !
Double up , men !
Hold them back !
Do not give in to fear .
Stand to your posts !
Not to the towers !
Aim for the trolls !
Kill the trolls !
Bring them down !
Fight them back !
Peregrin Took !
Go back to the Citadel !
They 'd called us out to fight .
This is no place for a Hobbit .
Guard of the Citadel , indeed .
Now , back , up the hill .
Quickly .
In there .
What is this place ?
Master must go inside the tunnel .
Now that I 'm here , I don 't think I want to .
It 's the only way .
Go in or go back .
I can 't go back .
What 's that smell ?
Orcses ' filth .
Orcses come in here sometimes .
Hurry .
This way .
Sméagol ?
Over here .
It 's sticky .
What is it ?
You 'lI see .
Oh , yes .
You will see .
Sméagol ?
Sméagol !
Sméagol !
Sam .
And you , Frodo Baggins I give you the light of Eirendil , our most beloved star .
May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out .
Naughty little fly . Why does he cry ?
Caught in a web Soon you 'll be ... Eaten .
Got away , did it , precious ?
Not this time .
Not this time !
It wasn 't us . It wasn 't us !
Sméagol wouldn 't hurt master .
We promised .
You must believe us .
It was the precious .
The precious made us do it .
I have to destroy it , Sméagol .
I have to destroy it for both our sakes .
No !
I 'm so sorry , Sam .
I 'm so sorry .
This task was appointed to you , Frodo of the Shire .
If you do not find a way no one will .
Back to the gate !
Hurry !
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir .
No long , slow sleep of death embalmed .
We shall burn , like the heathen kings of old .
Bring wood and oil .
Steady .
Steady .
You are soldiers of Gondor .
No matter what comes through that gate , you will stand your ground .
Volley !
Fire !
Let him go , you filth .
You will not touch him again .
Come on and finish it .
Back !
Mr. Frodo .
Oh , no .
Frodo .
Mr. Frodo .
Wake up .
Don 't leave me here alone .
Don 't go where I can 't follow .
Wake up .
Not asleep .
Dead .
What 's this ?
Looks like old Shelob 's been having a bit of fun .
Killed another one , has she ?
No .
This fellow ain 't dead .
Not dead ?
She jabs him with her stinger , and he goes as limp as a boned fish .
Then she has her way with them .
That 's how she likes to feed .
Fresh blood .
Get him to the tower !
Samwise , you fool .
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours .
Then he 'll wish he 'd never been born .
The house of his spirit crumbles .
He is burning .
Already burning .
He 's not dead .
He 's not dead !
No !
No !
No !
He 's not dead !
Farewell , Peregrin , son of Paladin . No !
I release you from my service .
Go now and die in what way seems best to you .
Pour oil on the wood !
Come on !
Move your feet !
Hurry along there !
Hurry along !
GandaIf !
The city is breached !
Fall back to the second level !
Get the women and children out ! Get them out !
Retreat !
Come on . Come on .
Move into the city .
Kill all in your path .
Take them down !
Fight .
Fight to the last man !
Fight for your lives !
Courage , Merry .
Courage for our friends .
Form ranks , you maggots .
Form ranks !
Pikes in front .
Archers behind .
Eomer , take your Bored down the left flank .
Flank ready .
Gamling , follow the king 's banner down the center .
Grimbold , take your company right after you pass the wall .
Forth , and fear no darkness !
Arise , arise , Riders of Théoden !
Spears shall be shaken , shields shall be splintered ...
... a sword-day , a red day ere the sun rises !
Whatever happens , stay with me .
I 'll look after you .
Ride now !
Ride now !
Ride for ruin and the world 's ending !
Death !
Death !
Death ! Death !
Death ! Death !
Forth Eorlingas !
Fire !
Charge !
Fire at will !
GandaIf !
GandaIf !
Denethor has lost his mind !
He 's burning Faramir alive !
Up !
Quickly !
Set a fire in our flesh .
Stay this madness !
No !
You will not take my son from me !
Faramir .
So passes Denethor , son of Ecthelion .
Drive them to the river !
Make safe the city !
Re-form the line !
Re-form the line !
Sound the charge !
Take them head-on !
Charge !
Take the reins .
Pull him left !
Left !
Aim for their heads !
Bring it down ! Bring it down !
Merry !
I didn 't think it would end this way .
End ?
No , the journey doesn 't end here .
Death is just another path one that we all must take .
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silver glass .
And then you see it .
What , GandaIf ?
See what ?
White shores and beyond .
A far green country under a swift sunrise .
Well that isn 't so bad .
No .
No , it isn 't .
Rally to me !
To me !
Feast on his flesh .
I will kill you if you touch him .
Do not come between the Nazgûl and his prey .
Late as usual , pirate scum !
There 's knife-work here needs doing .
Come on , you sea rats !
Get off your ships !
There 's plenty for the both of us .
May the best Dwarf win .
You fool .
No man can kill me .
Die now .
I am no man .
Fifteen !
Sixteen !
Seventeen !
Twenty-nine !
Legolas !
Thirty-three , thirty-four .
That still only counts as one !
All right , then .
Come on !
I know your face Eowyn .
My eyes darken .
No .
No .
I am going to save you .
You already did .
Eowyn my body is broken .
You have to let me go .
I go to my fathers in whose mighty company I shall not now feel ashamed .
Eowyn .
Release us .
Bad idea .
Very handy in a tight spot , these lads , despite the fact they 're dead .
You gave us your word .
I hold your oath fulfilled .
Go .
Be at peace .
Merry .
Merry , it 's me .
It 's Pippin .
I knew you 'd find me .
Yes .
Are you going to leave me ?
No , Merry .
I 'm going to look after you .
Hands off !
That shiny shirt , that 's mine .
It 's going to the Great Eye , along with everything else .
I don 't take orders from stinking Morgul rats !
You touch it , and I 'll stick this blade in your gut .
The scum tried to knife me .
Kill him !
That 's for Frodo !
And for the Shire !
And that 's for my old Gaffer !
Stop your squealing , you dunghill rat .
I 'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig .
Not if I stick you first .
Sam !
Oh , Sam , I 'm so sorry .
Sorry for everything .
Let 's get you out of here .
It 's too late .
It 's over .
They 've taken it .
Sam they took the Ring .
Begging your pardon , but they haven 't .
I thought I 'd lost you .
So I took it .
Only for safekeeping .
Give it to me .
Give me the Ring , Sam .
Sam .
Give me the Ring .
You must understand .
The Ring is my burden .
It will destroy you , Sam .
Come on , Mr. Frodo .
We best find you some clothes .
You can 't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin .
We did it , Mr. Frodo .
We made it to Mordor .
There are so many of them .
Well never get through unseen .
It 's him , the Eye .
We have to go in there , Mr. Frodo .
There 's nothing for it .
Come on .
Lets just make it down the hill for starters .
Frodo has passed beyond my sight .
The darkness is deepening .
If Sauron had the Ring , we would know it .
It 's only a matter of time .
He has suffered a defeat , yes but behind the walls of Mordor , our enemy is regrouping .
Let him stay there .
Let him rot !
Why should we care ?
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom .
I 've sent him to his death .
No .
There is still hope for Frodo .
He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth .
We can give him that .
Draw out Sauron 's armies . Empty his lands .
Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate .
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms .
Not for ourselves .
But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron 's Eye fixed upon us . Keep him blind to all else that moves .
A diversion .
Sauron will suspect a trap .
He will not take the bait .
Certainty of death small chance of success what are we waiting for ?
To the Gate , you slugs !
Move it !
To the Gate !
Look , the Orcs they 're moving off .
You see , Mr. Frodo some luck at last .
Take mine .
There 's a few drops left .
There will be none left for the return journey .
I don 't think there will be a return journey , Mr. Frodo .
Frodo , get down !
Hide !
Frodo !
Where are they ?
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth !
Let justice be done upon him !
Fall back .
It 's gone , Mr. Frodo .
The light 's passed on , away towards the north .
Something 's drawn its gaze .
Hold your ground ! Hold your ground .
Sons of Condor , of Rohan , my brothers !
I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me .
A day may come when the courage of Men fails when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship .
But it is not this day .
An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of Men comes crashing down .
But it is not this day .
This day we fight !
By all that you hold dear on this good earth I bid you stand , Men of the West !
Never thought I 'd die fighting side by side with an Elf .
What about side by side with a friend ?
Aye .
I could do that .
Do you remember the Shire , Mr. Frodo ?
It 'll be spring soon .
And the orchards will be in blossom .
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket .
And they 'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields and eating the first of the strawberries with cream .
Do you remember the taste of strawberries ?
No . Sam . I can 't recall the taste of food nor the sound of water nor the touch of grass .
I 'm ... naked in the dark .
There 's nothing . No veil between me and the wheel of fire .
I can see him with my waking eyes .
Then let us be rid of it once and for all .
Come on , Mr. Frodo .
I can 't carry it for you but I can carry you .
Come on !
Aragorn .
Aragorn .
For Frodo .
Look , Mr. Frodo .
A doorway .
Were almost there .
Clever Hobbits to climb so high !
Frodo !
Eagles .
The eagles are coming !
Frodo !
I 'm here , Sam .
Destroy it !
Go on !
Now ! Throw it in the fire !
What are you waiting for ?
Just let it go !
The Ring is mine .
No !
No !
No !
Yes !
Yes !
Precious !
Precious !
Precious !
Precious !
Give me your hand !
Take my hand !
No !
Don 't you let go .
Don 't let go .
Reach !
Frodo !
Frodo !
It 's gone .
It 's gone .
Yes , Mr. Frodo .
It 's over now .
I can see the Shire .
The Brandywine River .
Bag End .
GandaIf 's fireworks .
The lights in the Party Tree .
Rosie Cotton dancing .
She had ribbons in her hair .
If ever I was to marry someone it would 've been her .
It would 've been her .
I 'm glad to be with you , Samwise Gamgee here at the end of all things .
GandaIf ?
Frodo !
Gimli !
Now come the days of the king .
May they be blessed .
This day does not belong to one man but to all .
Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace .
My friends you bow to no one .
And thus it was . A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began .
And the Fellowship of the Ring though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended .
Thirteen months to the day ... since GandaIf sent us on our long journey we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight .
We were home .
Hey , watch the pumpkin .
Rosie , Rosie .
Good night , lads .
How do you pick up the threads of an old life ?
How do you go on when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back ?
There are some things that time cannot mend some hurts that go too deep that have taken hold .
Mr. Frodo ?
What is it ?
It 's been four years to the day since Weathertop , Sam .
It 's never really healed .
There and Back Again : A Hobbit 's Tate by Bilbo Baggins . And The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins .
You finished it .
Not quite .
There 's room for a little more .
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end that each of us must come and go in the telling .
Bilbo 's story was now over .
There would be no more journeys for him save one .
Tell me again , lad , where are we going ?
To the harbour , Bilbo .
The Elves have accorded you a special honour a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth .
Frodo any chance of seeing. that old Ring of mine again ?
The one I gave you .
Sorry , Uncle .
I 'm afraid I lost it .
Pity .
I should like to have held it one last time .
Well , here 's a sight I have never seen before .
The power of the Three Rings is ended .
The time has come for the dominion of Men .
The sea calls us home .
I think I 'm quite ready for another adventure .
Farewell my brave Hobbits .
My work is now finished .
Here at last , on the shores of the sea ...
I will not say , Do not weep for not all tears are an evil .
It is time , Frodo .
What does he mean ?
We set out to save the Shire , Sam .
And it has been saved .
But not for me .
You don 't mean that .
You can 't leave .
The last pages are for you , Sam .
My dear Sam :
You cannot always be torn in two .
You will have to be one and whole for many years .
You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do .
Your part in the story will go on .
Well I 'm back .
My dear Frodo
You asked me once ... if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures .
And while I can honestly ... say I have told you ... the truth ...
I may not have told you all of it .
I am old now , Frodo .
I 'm not the same Hobbit I once was .
I think ... it is time for you to know ... what really happened .
It began ... long ago ... in a land far away to the east ... the like of which you will not find in the world today .
There was the city of Dale .
It 's markets known ... far and wide .
Full of the bounties of vine and vale .
Peaceful and prosperous .
For this city lay before the doors ... of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth :
Erebor .
Stronghold of Thror ... King Under the Mountain . Mightiest ... of the Dwarf Lords .
Thror ruled with utter surety ... never doubting his house would endure ... for his line lay secure ... in the lives of his son ... and grandson .
Ah , Frodo . Erebor .
Built deep within the mountain itself ... the beauty of this fortress city was legend .
It 's wealth lay in the earth ... in precious gems hewn ... from rock and in great seams of gold ... running like rivers through stone .
The skill of the Dwarves ... was unequaled , fashioning objects ... of great beauty ... out of diamond , emerald , ruby and sapphire .
Ever they delved deeper ... down into the dark .
And that is where they found it .
The Heart of the Mountain .
The Arkenstone .
Thror named it The King 's Jewel .
He took it as a sign , a sign that his right to rule ... was divine .
All would pay ... homage to him .
Even the great ...
Elven King , Thranduil .
As the great wealth of the Dwarves grew ... their store of good will ran thin .
No one knows exactly what began the rift .
The Elves say ... the Dwarves stole their treasure .
The Dwarves tell another tale . They say the Elf King refused to give them their rightful pay .
It is sad , Frodo , how old alliances ... can be broken . How friendships between peoples can be lost .
And for what ?
Slowly the days turned sour ... and the watchful nights closed in .
Thror 's love of gold ... had grown too fierce .
A sickness had begun to grow within him .
It was a sickness of the mind .
And where sickness thrives ... bad things will follow .
The first they heard was a noise ... like a hurricane coming down ... from the North .
The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked ... in the hot , dry wind .
Balin , sound the alarm .
Call out the guard .
Do it now !
What is it ?
Dragon .
Dragon !
He was ... a firedrake from the North .
Smaug ... had come .
Such wanton death ... was dealt that day .
For this city of Men was nothing ... to Smaug .
His eye ... was set on another prize .
For dragons ... covet gold ... with a dark and ... fierce desire .
Aah !
No !
Come on .
Erebor was lost .
For a dragon ... will guard his plunder ... as long as he lives .
Run for your lives !
Ah !
Help us !
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against ... the wrath of the dragon .
No help came from the Elves ... that day , nor any day since .
Robbed of their homeland ... the Dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness ... a once mighty people brought low .
The young Dwarf prince took work where he could find it ... laboring in the villages of Men .
But always he remembered ... the mountain smoke beneath the moon ... the trees like torches blazing bright .
For he had seen dragon fire ... in the sky ... and a city turned to ash .
And he never forgave ... and he never forgot .
Far away , in another corner of the world ... dragons were ... only make-believe .
Up they go !
A party trick ... conjured by Wizards ... on Midsummer 's Eve .
No more frightening ... than fairy dust .
Bilbo !
And that , my dear Frodo ... is where I come in .
Bilbo !
Bilbo .
It was the beginning of an unlikely friendship ... that has lasted all my life .
But it is not the start of my story .
For me , it began ...
Well , it began as you might expect .
In a hole in the ground , there lived ... a Hobbit .
Not a nasty , dirty , wet hole full of worms and oozy smells .
This was a Hobbit hole . And that means good food , a warm hearth ... and all the comforts of home .
Thank you .
What 's this ?
That is private .
Keep your sticky paws off .
It 's not ready yet .
Not ready for what ?
Reading .
What on earth are these ?
Replies to the party invitations .
Ah .
Good gracious .
Is it today ?
They all say they 're coming .
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses , who are demanding you ask them in person .
Are they , indeed ?
Over my ...
- They 'd probably find that ... quite agreeable .
- dead body .
They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold .
It was one small chest , hardly overflowing .
And it still smells of Troll .
What on earth are you doing ?
Taking precautions . You know ...
I caught her making off with the silverware once .
- Who ?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins .
She had all my spoons stuffed in her pocket .
Ha !
Dreadful woman .
Make sure you keep an eye on her after I 'm ...
When I 'm ...
When I 'm ...
When you 're what ?
It 's nothing .
Nothing .
You know , some people are beginning to wonder about you , Uncle .
- Huh ?
- They think you 're becoming odd .
Odd ? Oh .
Hm .
Unsociable .
Unsociable , me ?
Nonsense .
Be a good lad and put that ... on the gate .
Do you think he 'll come ?
Who ?
Gandalf .
Oh-ho .
He wouldn 't miss a chance to let off his Whizpoppers .
He 'll give us ... quite a show , you 'll see .
Right , then .
I 'm off .
- Off to where ?
East-farthing Woods .
I 'm going to surprise him .
Well , go on , then .
You don 't want to be late .
He doesn 't approve of being late .
Not that I ... ever was .
In those days , I was always on time .
I was entirely respectable .
And nothing unexpected ... ever happened .
- Good morning .
What do you mean ?
Do you wish me a good morning or do you mean that it is a good morning ... whether I want it or not ?
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning ?
Or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on ?
Hm ?
All of them at once , I suppose .
Hmm .
Can I help you ?
That remains to be seen .
I 'm looking for someone to share in an adventure .
An adventure ?
No , I don 't imagine anyone west of Bree would have much interest in adventures .
Nasty , disturbing , uncomfortable things .
Make you late for dinner .
Heh , heh .
Mm .
Huh .
Hmm .
Oh .
Ah .
Good morning .
To think that I should have lived to be good morninged ... by Belladonna Took 's son as if I were selling buttons at the door .
Beg your pardon ?
You 've changed , and not entirely for the better ...
Bilbo Baggins .
I 'm sorry , do I know you ?
Well , you know my name , although you don 't remember I belong to it .
I 'm Gandalf .
And Gandalf means ... me .
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard ... who made such excellent ... fireworks ? Gandalf ?
Old Took used to have them on Midsummer 's Eve . Heh , heh .
Ahem .
No idea you were still in business .
And where else should I be ?
Where else ... ?
Ahem .
Well , I 'm pleased to find you remember something about me ... even if it 's only my fireworks .
Yes .
Well , that 's decided .
It 'll be very good for you ... and most amusing for me .
I shall inform the others .
Inform the who ?
What ?
No .
No . No ...
Wait .
We do not want ... any adventures here , thank you .
Not today . Not ...
I suggest you try Over the Hill or Across the Water .
Good morning .
Morning !
Twelve .
There we go . Have a very good day .
Chum .
Hello , Mr. Bilbo . Here .
Have a feel of me tubers .
Nice and firm , they are .
- Just come in from West Farthing .
- Very impressive , Mr. Worrywort .
Now , I don 't suppose you 've seen a Wizard lurking around these parts ?
A tall fellow .
Long , gray beard .
Pointy hat .
Can 't say I have .
Dwalin , at your service .
Hm .
Uh ...
Bilbo Baggins , at yours .
Do we ... know each other ?
No .
Which way , laddie ?
Is it down here ?
Is what ... down where ?
Supper .
He said there 'd be food and lots of it .
He ...
He said ?
Who said ?
Mmm .
Mmm .
Very good , this .
Any more ?
What ?
Oh , yes , yes .
Ah .
Help yourself .
Hmm .
It 's just that , urn , I wasn 't expecting company .
That 'll be the door .
Balin ... at your service .
Good evening .
Yes .
Yes , it is .
- Though I think it might rain later . - Hm ?
Am I late ?
Late for what ?
Oh !
Ha , ha !
Evening , brother .
By my beard ... you 're shorter and wider than last we met .
Wider , not shorter .
Sharp enough for both of us .
Uh , excuse me ?
Sorry , I hate to interrupt . But the thing is , I 'm not entirely sure you 're in the right house .
It 's not that I don 't like ... visitors . Have you eaten ?
I like visitors ... as much as the next Hobbit .
But I do like to know them before they come visiting .
- What is this ?
- I don 't know .
- I think it 's cheese .
Gone blue .
It 's riddled with mold .
The thing is , I don 't know either of you .
Not in the slightest .
I don 't mean ... to be blunt , but I had to speak my mind .
- I 'm sorry .
Apology accepted .
- Ah .
Now , fill it up , brother ... don 't stint .
You wanna get stuck in ?
- I could eat again if you insist , brother .
- Fili .
- And Kili .
At your service .
You must be Mr. Boggins .
Nope !
You can 't come in .
You 've come to the wrong house .
What ?
- Has it been canceled ?
- No one told us .
No , nothing 's been canceled .
That 's a relief .
Careful with these .
I just had them sharpened .
- It 's nice , this place .
Yeah .
- Did you do it yourself ?
- What ?
No , it 's been in the family for years .
That 's my mother 's glory box .
Can you please not do that ?
Fili , Kili .
Come on , give us a hand .
Mr. Dwalin .
Ha , ha .
Shove this in the hallway . Otherwise we 'll never get everyone in .
Everyone ?
How many more are there ?
Where do you want this ?
- Oh , no .
It 's really heavy .
No .
No .
There 's nobody home !
Go away and bother somebody else .
There 's far too many Dwarves in my dining room as it is .
If this is some clot-head 's idea of a joke ... I can only say it is in very ... poor taste .
Gandalf .
Excuse me , that 's my chicken .
Um ...
If ... If you don 't ...
That 's my wine .
Excuse me !
He 's got an injury .
You mean the ax in his head ?
Dead ?
No , only between his ears .
His legs work fine .
Put those back .
Put that back .
Put that back .
Not the jam .
Excuse me .
Excuse me .
It 's a tad excessive , isn 't it ?
Have you got a cheese knife ?
- Cheese knife ?
He eats it by the block .
Ugh .
No , that 's Grandpa Mungo 's chair ...
No , so is that .
Take it back , please .
- I cannot hear what you 're saying .
It 's an antique . Not for sitting on .
That is a book , not a coaster .
And put that map down .
- Excuse me , Mr. Gandalf ?
- Yes ?
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile ?
Oh , no , thank you , Dori .
A little red wine for me , I think .
Whoop ! Mind out .
- Yes .
Ah .
Uh , Fili , Kili .
Uh ...
Oin , Gloin .
Dwalin , Balin , Bifur , Bofur , Bombur ...
- Dori , Nori .
Ori ! - No .
Not my prizewinners , thank you .
No , thank you .
Yes , you 're quite right , Bifur .
We appear to be one Dwarf short .
He is late , is all .
He traveled north to a meeting of our kin .
He will come .
Mr. Gandalf ?
A little glass of red wine , as requested .
It 's got a fruity bouquet .
Oh .
Cheers .
Bombur 's on his second leg of lamb already .
Hmm .
No chance .
Not from that distance .
Bombur ... catch ! Wanna bet ?
I 'll help you with that .
Oh , you great ... galumphing git !
Who wants an ale ?
There you go .
Over here , brother .
Here you go .
Ale on the count of three !
One ...
- two ...
- Up !
I knew you had it in you !
Excuse me , that is a doily , not a dishcloth .
But it 's full of holes .
It 's supposed to look like that .
It 's crochet .
And a wonderful game it is too , if you 've got the balls for it .
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves !
My dear Bilbo , what on earth is the matter ?
What 's the matter ?
I 'm surrounded by Dwarves .
What are they doing here ?
Oh , they 're quite a merry gathering once you get used to them .
I don 't want to get used to them .
Look at the state of my kitchen .
There 's mud trod into the carpet .
They 've pillaged the pantry .
I won 't tell you what they 've done in the bathroom .
They 've destroyed the plumbing .
I don 't understand what they 're doing in my house !
Excuse me . I 'm sorry to interrupt , but what should I do with my plate ?
Here you go , Ori . Give it to me .
Take that back .
Excuse me .
That 's my mother 's ... West Farthing pottery .
It 's over ... 100 years old !
And can you ... not do that ?
You 'll blunt them .
Ooh . Do you hear that , lads ?
He says ... we 'll blunt the knives .
Blunt the knives , bend the forks .
Smash the bottles and burn the corks .
Chip the glasses and crack the plates .
That 's what Bilbo Baggins .
Hates .
Cut the cloth , tread on the fat .
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat .
Pour the milk on the pantry floor .
Splash the wine .
On every door .
Dump the crooks in a boiling bowl .
Pound them up with a thumping pole .
When you 're finished .
If they are whole .
Send them down the hall to roll .
That 's what Bilbo Baggins hates
Bilbo .
He is here .
Gandalf .
I thought you said ... this place would be easy ... to find .
I lost my way , twice .
I wouldn 't have found it at all had it not been for that mark on the door .
Mark ?
There 's no mark on that door .
It was painted a week ago .
There is a mark .
I put it there myself .
Bilbo Baggins , allow me to introduce the leader of our company :
Thorin Oakenshield .
So ... this is the Hobbit .
Tell me , Mr. Baggins , have you done much fighting ?
- Pardon me ?
Ax or sword ?
What 's your weapon of choice ?
Well , I do have some skill at conkers , if you must know ... but I fail to see why that 's relevant .
Thought as much .
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar .
What news ... from the meeting in Ered Luin ?
- Aye .
Envoys from all seven kingdoms .
All of them !
And what did the Dwarves of the Iron Hills say ?
Is Dain with us ?
They will not come .
They say this quest ... is ours and ours alone .
You 're going on a quest ?
Bilbo , my dear fellow , let us have a little more light .
Far to the east ... over ranges and rivers ... beyond woodlands and wastelands ... lies a single , solitary peak .
The Lonely Mountain .
Aye , Oin has read ... the portents , and the portents say it is time .
Ravens have been seen ... flying back to the mountain , as it was foretold .
When the birds of yore return ... to Erebor ... the reign of the beast ... ... will end .
- Uh , what beast ?
Airborne fire-breather .
Teeth like razors ... claws like meat hooks .
Fond of precious metals .
I know what a dragon is .
I 'm not afraid .
I 'm up for it .
I 'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron right up his jacksie !
Good lad , Ori !
The task would be difficult ... with an army behind us ... but we number just 13 .
Sit down .
And not 13 of the best ... nor brightest .
Here , who are you calling dim ?
Sorry , what did he say ?
We may be few in number ... but we 're fighters , all of us ... to the last Dwarf .
And you forget , we have a Wizard in our company .
Gandalf will have killed hundreds of dragons .
Oh , well , no .
I wouldn 't say ...
How many , then ?
- What ?
How many dragons have you killed ?
Go on .
Give us a number .
Excuse me .
Please .
If we have read these signs ... do you not think others will have read them too ?
Rumors have begun to spread .
The dragon , Smaug , has not been seen for 60 years .
Eyes look east to the mountain , assessing ... wondering , weighing the risk .
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected .
Do we sit back while others claim what is rightfully ours ?
Or do we seize this chance ... to take back Erebor ?
You forget , the Front Gate is sealed .
There is no way ... into the mountain .
That , my dear Balin , is not entirely true .
How came you by this ?
It was given to me ... by your father .
By Thrain .
For safekeeping .
It is yours ... now .
If there is a key ... there must be a door .
These runes ... speak of a hidden passage to the Lower Halls .
There 's another way in .
Well , if we can find it , but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed .
The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map ... and I do not have the skill to find it . But there are others in Middle-earth who can .
The task I have in mind will require a great deal of stealth ... and no small amount of courage .
But if we are careful and clever , I believe that it can be done .
That 's why we need a burglar .
Hmm .
And a good one too .
An expert , I 'd imagine .
And are you ?
Am I what ?
He said he 's an expert .
Hey .
Me ? No .
No , no , no .
I 'm not a burglar .
I 've never stolen a thing in my life .
Well , I 'm afraid I have to agree with Mr. Baggins .
He 's hardly burglar material .
Nope .
Aye , the Wild is no place for gentle folk who can neither fight nor fend for themselves .
He 's just fine .
Enough !
If I say Bilbo Baggins ... is a burglar , then a burglar ... he is .
Hobbits are light ... on their feet .
In fact , they can pass unseen by most , if they choose .
And , while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of Dwarf ... the scent of a Hobbit is all but ... unknown to him , which gives us a distinct advantage .
You asked me to find the 14th member of this company ... and I have chosen Mr. Baggins .
There 's more to him ... than appearances suggest . And he 's got a great deal more to offer than any of you know .
Including himself .
You must trust me on this .
Very well .
- We will do it your way .
- No , no .
Give him the contract . - We 're in .
We 're off .
It 's just the usual .
Summary ... of out-of-pocket expenses , time required ... remuneration ... funeral arrangements , so forth .
Funeral arrangements ?
I cannot guarantee his safety .
Understood .
Nor will I be responsible for his fate .
Agreed .
Terms Cash on ...
delivery , up to but not exceeding one-fourteenth of total profit , if any .
Hmm .
Seems fair .
Present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by ... or sustained as a consequence thereof , including , but not limited to lacerations ...
... evisceration ...
- Incineration ?
Aye . He 'll melt the flesh off your bones in the blink of an eye .
You all right , laddie ?
Huh ?
Yeah .
Feel a bit faint .
- Think furnace with wings .
I need air .
Hmm .
Nope .
Oh , very helpful , Bofur .
I 'll be all right .
Just let me sit quietly for a moment .
You 've been sitting quietly for far too long .
Tell me ... when did doilies and your mother 's dishes ... become so important to you ?
I remember a young Hobbit who was always running off in search of Elves in the woods .
Who would stay out late , come home after dark ... trailing mud and twigs and fireflies .
A young Hobbit who would have liked nothing better ... than to find out what was beyond the borders of the Shire .
The world ... is not in your books and maps .
It 's out ... there .
I can 't just go running off into the blue .
I am a Baggins of Bag-end .
You are also a Took .
Did you know ... that your great-great-great-great-uncle ...
Bullroarer Took was so large ... he could ride a real horse ?
- Yes .
- Yes ... well , he could .
In the Battle of Green Fields , he charged the Goblin ranks .
He swung his club so hard , it knocked the Goblin king 's head clean off ... and it sailed 100 yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole .
And thus , the battle was won .
And the game of golf invented at the same time .
I do believe you made that up .
Well , all good stories deserve embellishment .
You 'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back .
Can you promise that I will come back ?
No .
And if you do ... you will not be the same .
That 's what I thought .
Sorry , Gandalf , I can 't sign this .
You 've got the wrong Hobbit .
It appears we have lost our burglar .
Probably for the best .
The odds were always against us .
After all , what are we ?
Merchants , miners ... tinkers , toy-makers .
Heh , heh .
Hardly the stuff of legend .
There are a few warriors amongst us .
Old warriors .
I would take each and every one of these Dwarves ... over an army from the Iron Hills .
For when I called upon them , they answered .
Loyalty , honor ... a willing heart .
I can ask no more than that .
You don 't ... have to do this .
You have a choice .
You 've done honorably by our people .
You have built a new life for us in the Blue Mountains .
A life of peace ... and plenty .
A life that is worth more than all the gold in Erebor .
From my grandfather to my father , this has come to me .
They dreamt of the day ... when the Dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland .
There is no choice , Balin .
Not for me .
Then we are with you , laddie .
We will see it done .
Far over .
The misty mountains cold .
To dungeons deep .
And caverns old .
We must away
'Ere break of day .
To find our .
Long-forgotten gold .
The pines were roaring .
On the height .
The winds .
Were moaning .
In the night .
The fire was red .
It flaming spread .
The trees like torches .
Blazed with light
Hello ?
Yes .
Yes .
Here ... Mr. Bilbo , where are you off to ?
- Can 't stop , I 'm already late !
- Late for what ?
I 'm going on an adventure !
I said it .
Didn 't I say it ?
Coming here was a waste of time .
That 's true enough .
Ridiculous notion . Use a Hobbit ? A Halfling ?
Whose idea was it anyway ?
Wait !
Wait !
Whoa , whoa .
Whoa , whoa .
I signed it .
Here .
Everything appears ... to be in order .
Welcome , Master Baggins ... to the company of Thorin Oakenshield .
Give him a pony .
No , no , that won 't be necessary .
Thank you .
I 'm sure I can keep up on foot .
I 've done my fair share of walking holidays , you know ?
Even got as far as Frogmorton once .
Aah !
Come on , Nori .
Pay up .
One more .
Thanks , lad .
What 's that about ?
Oh , they took wagers on whether or not you 'd turn up .
Most of them bet that you wouldn 't .
And what did you think ?
Well ...
My dear fellow , I never doubted you for a second .
It 's horse hair .
Having a reaction .
No , wait , wait , stop .
Stop !
We have to turn around .
- I forgot my handkerchief .
Here .
Use this .
Move on .
You 'll have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs ... and a good many other things , Bilbo Baggins ... before we reach our journey 's end .
You were born ... to the rolling hills and little rivers of the Shire .
But home is now behind you .
The world is ahead .
Hello , girl .
Who 's a good girl ?
It 's our little secret , Myrtle .
You must tell no one .
Shh , shh .
What was that ?
Orcs .
Ores ?
Throat-cutters .
There 'll be dozens of them out there .
The lone-lands ... are crawling with them .
They strike ... in the wee small hours when everyone 's asleep .
Quick and quiet , no screams .
Just lots of blood .
You think that 's funny ?
You think a night raid by Ores is a joke ?
We didn 't mean anything by it .
No , you didn 't .
You know nothing of the world .
Don 't mind him , laddie .
Thorin has more ' cause than most to hake Ores .
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain ... King Thror ... tried to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria .
But our enemy had got there first .
Moria had been taken by legions of Ores ... led by the most vile ... of all their race :
Azog ... the Defiler .
The giant Gundabad Orc ... had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin .
He began ... by beheading the king .
No !
Thrain , Thorin 's father ... was driven mad by grief .
Taken prisoner or killed ... we did not know .
He went missing .
We were leaderless .
Defeat and death ... were upon us .
That is when I saw him .
A young Dwarf prince ... facing down ... the pale Orc .
He stood alone ... against this terrible foe .
His armor rent ... wielding nothing ... but an oaken branch ... as a shield .
Azog ... the Defiler learned that day ... that the line of Durin would not be so easily broken .
Our forces rallied ... and drove the Orcs back .
And our enemy ... had been defeated .
But there was no feast ... nor song that night ... for our dead were beyond the count of grief .
We few had survived .
And I thought to myself then ... there is one who I could follow .
There is one ... I could call king .
And the pale Orc ?
What happened to him ?
He slunk back into the hole whence he came .
That filth died of his wounds long ago .
Here , Mr. Gandalf ... can 't you do something about this deluge ?
It is raining , Master Dwarf ... and it will continue to rain until the rain is done .
If you wish to change ... the weather of the world , find yourself another Wizard .
- Are there any ?
What ?
Other Wizards .
There are five of us .
The greatest of our order is Saruman the White .
Then there are the two Blue Wizards ... Do you know , I 've quite forgotten their names .
And who is the fifth ?
Well , that would be Radagast the Brown .
Is he a great Wizard ? Or is he more like you ?
I think he 's a very great Wizard , in his own way .
He 's a gentle soul ... who prefers the company of animals to others .
He keeps a watchful eye over the vast forest lands ... to the east .
And a good thing too . For always evil will look to find a foothold in this world .
Not good .
Not good at all .
Eww .
Oh , no . Sebastian .
Good gracious .
Give him some air ... for goodness sake .
Come on .
There .
There .
I don 't understand why it 's not working .
It 's not as if it 's witchcraft .
Witchcraft .
Oh , but it is .
A dark and powerful magic .
Where on ... this good earth did those foul creatures come from ?
The old fortress ?
Show me .
We 'll camp here for the night .
Fili , Kili , look after the ponies .
Make sure you stay with them .
A farmer and his family used to live here .
Oin , Gloin .
Get a fire going .
Aye .
Right you are .
I think it would be wiser to move on .
We could make for the Hidden Valley .
I have told you already ...
I will not go near that place .
Why not ?
The Elves could help us .
We could get food , rest , advice .
I do not need their advice .
We have a map ... that we cannot read .
Lord Elrond could help us .
Help ?
A dragon attacks Erebor .
What help came from the Elves ?
Orcs plunder Moria ... desecrate our sacred halls .
The Elves looked on ... and did nothing .
And you ask me to seek out the very people who betrayed my grandfather .
Who betrayed my father .
You are neither of them .
I did not ... give you that map and key for you to hold onto the past .
I did not know that they were yours to keep .
Everything all right ?
Gandalf , where are you going ?
To seek the company of the only one around here who 's got any sense .
And who 's that ?
Myself , Mr. Baggins .
I 've had enough of Dwarves for one day .
Come on , Bombur , we 're hungry .
Is he coming back ?
He 's been a long time .
- Who ?
- Gandalf .
He 's a Wizard .
He does as he chooses .
Here , do us a favor . Take this to the lads .
Stop it .
You 've had plenty .
Aye , it 's not a bad stew , Bombur .
I 've had worse .
Dori could 've cooked it .
Ha-ha-ha .
Hilarious .
What 's the matter ?
- We 're supposed to be looking after the ponies .
- Only we 've encountered a slight problem .
We had 16 .
Now there 's 14 .
Daisy and Bungo are missing .
Well , that 's not good .
Ha , ha .
And that is not good at all .
Shouldn 't we tell Thorin ?
Uh , no .
Let 's not worry him .
As our official burglar , we thought you might like to look into it .
Well , uh ...
- Look , something big uprooted these trees .
- That was our thinking .
It 's something very big and possibly quite dangerous .
Hey .
There 's a light .
Over here .
Stay down .
What is it ?
Trolls .
Oh .
He 's got Myrtle and Minty .
I think they 're gonna eat them .
We have to do something .
Yes , you should .
Mountain Trolls are slow ... and stupid , and you 're small , they 'll never see you .
It 's perfectly safe .
We 'll be behind you .
If you run into trouble , hoot twice like a barn owl ... and once like a brown owl .
Twice like a barn owl . No , twice like a brown ...
Like a ... Are you sure this is a good idea ?
Mutton yesterday , mutton today ... and , blimey , if it don 't look like mutton again tomorrow .
Quit your griping .
These ain 't sheep .
These is fresh nags .
Oh !
I don 't like horse .
I never have .
- Not enough fat on them .
Well , it 's better ... than leathery old farmer .
All skin and bone , he was .
I 'm still picking ... bits of him out of me teeth .
Well , that 's lovely , that is .
Might improve the flavor .
Ah .
There 's more where that came from .
- Oh , no , you don 't !
Ow !
Sit down !
Well , I hope you 're gonna gut these nags .
I don 't like the stinky parts .
- Ow !
- I said sit down .
I 'm starving !
Now , are we having horse tonight or what ?
Shut your cakehole .
You 'll eat what I give you .
How come he 's the cook ?
Everything tastes the same .
Everything tastes like chicken .
Except the chicken .
What tastes like fish !
I 'm just saying , a little appreciation would be nice .
Oh . Thank you very much , Bert .
Lovely stew , Bert .
- How hard is that ?
- Shh .
Shh , shh .
Shh .
Just needs ... a sprinkle of squirrel dung .
Here ... that 's my grog .
Sorry .
Ow !
Ooh . That is beautifully balanced , that is .
Wrap your laughing gear around that , eh ?
Good , isn 't it ?
That 's why I 'm the cook .
Oh , me guts are grumbling .
I got to snaffle something .
- Flesh , I need flesh .
Ah !
Ah !
Blimey !
Bert .
Bert !
Look what 's come out of me hooter .
It 's got arms and legs and everything .
What is it ?
- I don 't know .
I don 't like the way it wriggles around .
What are you , then ?
An oversized squirrel ?
I 'm a burglar ...
Uh , Hobbit .
A burglar Hobbit ?
Can we cook him ?
We can try .
He wouldn 't make more than a mouthful .
Not when he 's skinned and boned .
Perhaps there 's more ... burglar Hobbits around these parts .
Might be enough ... for a pie .
- Grab him !
He 's too quick .
Come here , you little ...
Gotcha .
Are there any more of you little fellas ...
- hiding where you shouldn 't ?
- No .
He 's lying .
- No , I 'm not !
- Hold his toes over the fire .
Make him squeal !
Drop him !
You what ?
I said ... drop him .
Get the sacks !
Stick them in the sacks !
Ow !
Come on ! Get up !
- Bilbo !
- Don 't !
Lay down your arms ... or we 'll rip his off .
Oh !
That 's hot , that 's hot , that 's hot !
- Don 't bother cooking them .
Let 's just sit on them and squash them into jelly .
They should be sauteed and grilled with a sprinkle of sage .
Is this really necessary ?
That does sound quite nice .
Untie me , mister .
Eat someone your own size .
Never mind the seasoning .
We ain 't got all night . Dawn ain 't ... far away .
Let 's get a move on .
I don 't fancy being turned to stone .
Wait !
You are making ... a terrible mistake .
You can 't reason with them .
- They 're half-wits !
Half-wits ?
What does that make us ?
I meant with ... the seasoning .
What about the seasoning ?
Well , have you smelt them ?
You 're gonna need something stronger than sage before you plate this lot up .
What do you know ... about cooking Dwarf ?
Shut up .
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk .
The secret to cooking Dwarf is ...
Yes ?
Come on . Tell us the secret .
The secret is ... to skin them first .
- It 's , uh ...
Yes , I 'm telling you .
What ? Skin us ?
Tom , get me filleting knife .
I 'll skin you , you little ... !
I won 't forget that .
I won 't forget it .
What a load of rubbish .
I 've eaten plenty with their skins on .
Scarf them , I say ... boots and all .
He 's right .
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf .
Nice and crunchy .
Oh , not that one .
He 's infected .
Huh ?
You what ?
Yeah , he 's got worms in his tubes .
Eww !
Aah !
In fact , they all have .
They 're infested with parasites .
It 's a terrible business .
I wouldn 't risk it . I wouldn 't .
Parasites ?
Did he say parasites ?
We don 't have parasites .
You have parasites !
What are you talking about , laddie ?
I 've got parasites as big as my arm .
Mine are the biggest parasites .
I 've got huge parasites .
We 're riddled .
Yes , I 'm riddled .
Yes , we are , badly .
What would you have us do , then ?
Let them all go ?
- Well ...
You think ... I don 't know what you 're up to ?
This little ... ferret is taking us for fools .
Ferret ?
Fools ?
The dawn will take you all .
Who 's that ?
No idea .
Can we eat him too ?
Get your foot out of my back .
Ah .
Where did you ... go to , if I may ask ?
To look ahead .
What brought you back ?
Looking behind .
Nasty business .
Still , they 're all in one piece .
No thanks to your burglar .
He had the nous to play for time .
None of the rest of you thought of that .
They must have come down from the Ettenmoors .
Since when do Mountain Trolls venture this far south ?
Ooh .
Not for an age .
Not since a darker power ruled these lands .
They could not have moved in daylight .
There must be a cave nearby .
Oh , what 's that stench ?
It 's a Troll-hoard .
Be careful what you touch .
Seems a shame just to leave it ... lying around .
- Anyone could take it .
- Agreed .
- Nori .
Yeah ?
Get a shovel .
These swords were not made by any Troll .
Nor were they made by any smith among Men .
These were forged in Gondolin ... by the High Elves of the First Age .
You could not ... wish for a finer blade .
Set it down .
That 's good .
All right , come on . Quick .
We 're making a long-term deposit .
Let 's get out of this foul place .
Come on , let 's go .
Bofur , Gloin , Nori .
Bilbo .
Hmm ?
Here .
This is about your size .
I can 't take this .
The blade is of Elvish make ... which means ... it will glow blue when Ores or Goblins are nearby .
I have never used a sword in my life .
And I hope you never have to .
But if you do , remember this :
True courage is about knowing not when to take a life ... but when to spare one .
Something 's coming !
Gandalf .
Stay together !
Hurry now !
Arm yourselves !
Thieves !
Fire !
Murder !
Radagast .
It 's Radagast the Brown .
Well ...
What on earth are you doing here ?
I was looking for you , Gandalf .
Something 's wrong .
Something 's terribly wrong .
Yes ?
Oh .
Just give me a minute .
Oh .
I had a thought and now I 've lost it .
It was right there ... on the tip of my tongue .
Oh .
It 's not a thought at all .
It 's a silly old ... stick insect .
The Greenwood is sick , Gandalf .
A darkness has fallen over it .
Nothing grows anymore .
At least , nothing good .
The air is foul with decay .
But worse are the webs .
Webs ?
What do you mean ?
Spiders , Gandalf .
Giant ones .
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant , or I am not a Wizard .
I followed their trail .
They came from Dol Guldur .
Huh ?
Dol Guldur ?
But the old fortress is abandoned .
No , Gandalf .
'Tis not .
A dark power dwells in there ... such as I have never ... felt before .
It is the shadow of an ancient horror .
One that can summon the spirits ... of the dead .
I saw him , Gandalf .
From out of the darkness ... a Necromancer ... has come .
Radagast .
Quick !
Quick , quick !
Quick , quick !
Wait for me !
Sorry .
Try a little Old Toby .
It 'll help settle your nerves .
And out .
Now ... a Necromancer .
Are you sure ?
That is not ... from the world of the living .
Was that a wolf ?
Are there wolves out there ?
Wolves ?
No , that is not a wolf .
Kili !
Get your bow !
Warg scouts .
Which means an Orc pack is not far behind .
Orc pack ?
Who did you tell about your quest ... beyond your kin ?
No one .
Who did you tell ?
No one , I swear .
What in ... Durin 's name is going on ?
You are being hunted .
We have to get out of here .
We can 't .
We have no ponies .
They bolted .
I 'll draw them off .
These are Gundabad Wargs .
They will outrun you .
These are Rhosgobel rabbits .
I 'd like to see them try .
Come on !
Come on !
Come and get me !
Ha , ha !
Come on .
Stay together .
Move !
Ori , no !
Get back .
All of you , come on .
Where are you leading us ?
Move !
Run !
There they are !
This way !
Quickly !
There 's more coming !
Shoot them !
We 're surrounded !
Where 's Gandalf ?
He 's abandoned us .
Hold your ground !
This way , you fools !
Come on , move !
Quickly !
All of you !
Come on !
Go , go , go !
Eight , nine , 10 .
Kili !
Run !
Elves .
I cannot see ... where the pathway leads . Do we follow it or no ?
Follow it , of course .
I think that would be wise .
Gandalf .
Where are we ?
You can feel it ?
Yes .
It feels like ...
Well , like magic .
That 's exactly what it is .
A very powerful magic .
There 's light ahead .
The Valley of Imladris .
In the common tongue , it 's known by another name .
Rivendell .
Here lies the Last Homely House East of the Sea .
This was your plan all along .
To seek refuge with our enemy .
You have no enemies here , Thorin Oakenshield .
The only ill will to be found ... in this valley is that which you bring yourself .
You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing ?
They will try to stop us .
Of course they will .
But we have questions that need to be answered .
If we are to be successful , this will need to be handled with tact .
And respect .
And no small degree of charm .
Which is why you will leave the talking to me .
Mithrandir .
Ah .
Lindir .
Stay sharp .
I must speak with Lord Elrond .
My Lord Elrond is not here .
Not here ?
Where is he ?
Close ranks !
Gandalf .
Lord Elrond .
Strange for Orcs to come so close to our borders .
Something or someone has drawn them near .
Ah .
That may have been us .
Welcome , Thorin , son of Thrain .
I do not believe we have met .
You have your grandfather 's bearing .
I knew Thror when he ruled ...
- Under the Mountain .
- Indeed ?
He made no mention of you .
What is he saying ?
Does he offer us insult ?
No , Master Gloin , he 's offering you food .
Well ... in that case , lead on .
Hey . Come on .
Try it .
Just a mouthful .
I don 't like green food .
Where 's the meat ?
Have they got any chips ?
Kind of you ... to invite us .
Not really dressed for dinner .
Well , you never are .
I can 't say I fancy Elf maids myself , too thin .
They 're all high cheekbones ... and creamy skin .
Not enough facial hair for me .
Although that one there is not bad .
That 's not an Elf maid .
That 's funny .
This is Orcrist , the Goblin-cleaver .
A famous blade ... forged by the High Elves of the West , my kin .
May it serve you well .
And this ... is Glamdring ... the Foehammer .
Sword ... of the King of Gondolin .
These were made for the Goblin Wars of the First Age .
I wouldn 't bother , laddie .
Swords are named for the great deeds they do in war .
What are you saying , my sword hasn 't seen battle ?
I 'm not actually sure it is a sword .
More of a letter opener , really .
- How did you come by these ?
- We found them ... in a Troll-hoard on the Great East Road ... shortly before ...
- we were ambushed by Ores .
- And what were you doing ... on the Great East Road ?
Excuse me .
Thirteen Dwarves ... and a Halfling .
Hm .
Strange traveling companions , Gandalf .
These are the descendants of the house of Durin .
They 're noble , decent folk .
And they 're surprisingly cultured .
They 've got a deep love ...
- of the arts .
- Change the tune , why don 't you ?
I feel like I 'm at a funeral .
- Did somebody die ?
There 's only one thing for it .
There 's .
An .
Inn , there 's an inn There 's a merry old inn .
Beneath an old gray hill .
And there they brew a beer so brown The Man in the Moon .
Himself came down One night .
To drink his fill .
Oh .
The ostler has a tipsy cat .
That played a five-stringed fiddle .
And up and down he saws his bow .
Now squeaking high .
Now purring low
Now sawing in the middle .
So .
The cat on the fiddle .
Played hey-diddle-diddle A drink that 'll wake the dead .
He squeaked and he sawed And he quickened .
The tune And the landlord .
Shook the Man .
In the Moon it 's after . Three ! he said
Our business is no concern of Elves .
For goodness sake , Thorin ... show him the map .
It is mine to protect , as are it 's secrets .
Save me from the stubbornness of Dwarves .
Your pride will be your downfall .
You stand in the presence of one of the few in Middle-earth ... who can read that map .
Show it to Lord Elrond .
Thorin , no .
Erebor .
What is your interest ... in this map ?
It 's mainly academic .
As you know ... this sort of artifact sometimes contains hidden text .
You still read ancient Dwarvish , do you not ?
Moon runes ?
Of course .
An easy thing to miss .
Well , in this case , that is true .
Moon runes can only be read by the light of a moon ... of the same shape and season ... as the day on which they were written .
Can you read them ?
These runes were written on a Midsummer 's Eve ... by the light of a crescent moon nearly 200 years ago .
It would seem you were meant to come to Rivendell .
Fate is with you ...
Thorin Oakenshield . The same moon ... shines upon us tonight .
Stand by the ... gray stone when the thrush knocks ... and the setting sun with the last light of Durin 's Day ...
- ... will shine upon the keyhole .
- Durin 's Day ?
It is the start of the Dwarves ' new year , when the last moon of autumn ... and the first sun of winter appear in the sky together .
This is ill news .
Summer is passing .
Durin 's Day will soon be upon us .
We still have time .
- Time ?
For what ?
- To find the entrance .
We have to be standing in exactly the right spot at exactly the right time .
Then , and only then , can the door be opened .
So this is ... your purpose , to enter the mountain ?
What of it ?
There are some who would not deem it wise .
What do you mean ?
You are not the only guardian to stand watch over Middle-earth .
AZOG IN
Uh , no , I shan 't be missed .
The truth is that most of them don 't think I should be on this journey .
Indeed ?
I 've heard that Hobbits are very resilient .
Really ?
Mm .
I 've also heard they 're fond of the comforts of home .
I 've heard that it 's unwise to seek the council of Elves . That they will answer with yes and no .
You are very welcome to stay here , if that ... is your wish .
No , you did the same thing .
It 's not like you didn 't do it .
Dori !
Here , take that .
Born bur !
Of course I was going to tell you .
I was waiting ... for this very chance .
And really , I think you can trust that I know what I am doing .
That dragon has slept ... for 60 years .
What will happen if your plan should fail ...
- if you wake that beast ?
- What if we succeed ?
If the Dwarves take back the mountain ... our defenses in the east will be strengthened .
It is a dangerous move , Gandalf .
It is also dangerous to do nothing .
Oh , come , the throne of Erebor is Thorin 's birthright .
What is it you fear ?
Have you forgotten ?
A strain of madness runs deep in that family .
His grandfather lost his mind .
His father succumbed to ... the same sickness .
Can you swear Thorin Oakenshield ... will not also fall ?
Gandalf , these decisions do not rest with us alone .
It is not ... up to you or me to redraw the map of Middle-earth .
With or without our help , these Dwarves will march on the mountain .
They 're determined to reclaim their homeland .
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield feels that he is answerable to anyone .
Nor , for that matter , am I.
It is not me you must answer to .
Lady Galadriel .
Mithrandir .
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you .
He didn 't .
I did .
Ah .
Saruman .
You 've been busy of late , my friend .
Tell me , Gandalf ... did you think these plans and schemes of yours ... would go unnoticed ?
Unnoticed ?
No .
I 'm simply doing what I feel to be right .
The dragon has long been on your mind .
That is true , my lady .
Smaug owes allegiance to no one .
But if he should side with the enemy ... a dragon could be used to terrible effect .
What enemy ?
Gandalf , the enemy is defeated .
Sauron is vanquished .
He can never regain his full strength .
Does it not worry you that the last of the Dwarf rings ... should simply vanish ... along with it 's bearer ?
Of the seven Dwarf rings , four were consumed by dragons ... two were taken by Sauron before he fell in Mordor .
The fate of the last Dwarf ring remains unknown .
The ring that was worn by Thrain .
Without the ruling Ring of Power ... the seven are of no value to the enemy .
To control ... the other rings ... he needs the One .
And that ring was lost long , long ago .
It was swept out ... to sea by the waters of the Anduin .
Gandalf , for 400 years we have lived in peace ... a hard-won ... watchful peace .
Are we ?
Are we at peace ?
Trolls have come down from the mountains .
They are raiding villages , destroying farms .
Orcs have attacked us on the road .
Hardly a prelude to war .
Always you must meddle ... looking for trouble where none exists .
Let him speak .
There is something at work beyond the evil of Smaug .
Something far more powerful .
We can remain blind to it , but it will not be ignoring us , that I can promise you .
A sickness lies over the Greenwood .
The woodsmen who live there now call it Mirkwood .
And they say ...
Well ?
Don 't stop now .
Tell us what the woodsmen say .
They speak of a Necromancer ... living in Dol Guldur .
A sorcerer who can summon the dead .
That 's absurd .
No such power exists in this world .
This Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man .
A conjurer dabbling in black magic .
And so I thought too .
- But Radagast has seen ...
Radagast ?
Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown .
He 's a foolish fellow .
Well , he 's odd , I grant you .
He lives a solitary life .
It 's not that .
It 's his excessive ... consumption of mushrooms .
They 've addled his brain ... and yellowed his teeth .
I 've warned him .
It is unbefitting one of the Istari to be wandering the woods ...
You carry something .
It came to you from Radagast .
He found it in Dol Guldur .
Yes .
Show me .
Listen to me .
I would think I was talking to myself for all the attention that he paid .
By all means ...
What is that ?
A relic of Mordor .
A Morgul Blade .
Made for the Witchking of Angmar .
And buried with him .
When Angmar fell ... the Men of the North took his body ... and all that he possessed and sealed it within the High Fells of Rhudaur .
Deep within the rock they buried him ... in a tomb so dark ... it would never come to light .
This is not possible .
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs .
They cannot be opened .
What proof do we have this weapon came from Angmar 's grave ?
I have none .
Because there is none .
Let us examine what we know .
A single Orc pack ... has dared to cross the Bruinen .
A dagger from a bygone age has been found .
And a human sorcerer who calls himself The Necromancer ... has taken up residence in a ruined fortress .
It 's not so very much after all .
The question of this Dwarvish company , however ... troubles me deeply .
I 'm not convinced , Gandalf .
I do not feel I can condone such a quest .
If they 'd come to me , I might have spared them this disappointment .
I do not pretend to understand your reason for raising their hopes .
They are leaving .
Yes .
You knew .
No , I 'm afraid there is ... nothing else for it .
My Lord Elrond .
The Dwarves , they 're gone .
Be on your guard .
We 're about to step over the Edge of the Wild .
Balin , you know these paths . Lead on .
Aye .
Master Baggins ... I suggest you keep up .
You will follow them .
Yes .
You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield .
But I fear this quest has set in motion ... forces we do not yet understand .
The riddle of the Morgul Blade must be answered .
Something moves in the shadows unseen , hidden from our sight .
It will not show itself .
Not yet .
But every day it grows in strength .
You must be careful .
Mithrandir ?
Why the Halfling ?
I do not know .
Saruman believes that it is only great power ... that can hold evil in check .
But that is not what I have found .
I have found it is the small things ... everyday deeds of ordinary folk ... that keeps the darkness at bay .
Simple acts of kindness and love .
Why Bilbo Baggins ?
Perhaps it is because I 'm afraid ... and he gives me courage .
Do not be afraid , Mithrandir .
You are not alone .
Hey !
Hold on !
Aah !
Bilbo !
We must find ... shelter !
Look out !
Look out , brother !
Hold on !
This is no thunderstorm .
It 's a thunder-battle !
Look !
Well , bless me .
The legends are true .
Giants !
Stone-Giants !
Take cover , you fool !
Hold on !
What 's happening ?
Grab my hand !
Go , go , go !
Run ! Get off !
Get off !
- Run !
Hold on !
Look out !
Jump !
Come on !
Hold on !
No !
No !
No !
Kili !
It 's all right !
They 're alive !
Where 's Bilbo ?
Where 's the Hobbit ?
There !
Get him !
Aah !
Grab my hand !
Bilbo !
Ori , be careful !
Take it !
I 've got you , lad .
Grab on !
Grab on !
Come on .
Get him .
Come on , lad .
Up you get .
I thought we 'd lost our burglar .
He 's been lost ever since he left home .
He should never have come .
He has no place amongst us .
Dwalin !
It looks safe enough .
Search to the back .
Caves in the mountain are seldom unoccupied .
There 's nothing here .
Right , then . Let 's get a fire started .
No .
No fires .
Not in this place .
Get some sleep .
We start at first light .
We were to wait in the mountains until Gandalf joined us .
That was the plan .
Plans change .
Bofur , take the first watch .
Where do you think ... you 're going ?
Back to Rivendell .
No , no , you can 't turn back now , eh ?
You 're part of the company .
You 're one of us .
I 'm not , though , am I ?
Thorin said I should never have come and he was right .
I 'm not a Took ...
I 'm a Baggins .
I don 't know what I was thinking .
I should never have run out my door .
You 're homesick .
I understand .
No , you don 't .
You don 't understand .
None of you do .
You 're Dwarves .
You 're used to this life .
To living on the road ... never settling in one place , not belonging anywhere !
Oh , I am sorry . I didn 't ...
No , you 're right .
We don 't belong anywhere .
I wish you all the luck in the world .
I really do .
What 's that ?
Hmm ?
Wake-up !
Wake-up !
Whoa !
Look out !
Get away !
Filthy scum !
Get back !
You 'll pay for this !
Got you .
All right , all right .
Get off ! Get your hands off me !
Get off me !
Get off me !
I feel a song coming on .
Clap , snap The black crack .
Grip , grab Pinch and nab .
Batter and beat .
Make ' em stammer and .
Squeak .
Pound , pound Far .
Underground .
Down , down , down in Goblin-town .
Down , down , down in Goblin-town .
With a swish and a smack And a whip and a crack .
Everybody talks When they 're on my rack .
Pound , pound Far underground .
Down , down , down to Goblin-town .
Down , down , down to Goblin-town .
Hammer and tongs Get out your knockers and gongs .
You won 't last long On the end of my prong .
Clash , crash .
Crush and smash .
Bang , break Shiver and shake .
You can yammer and yelp But there ain 't no help .
Pound , pound Far underground .
Down , down , down in Goblin .
Town .
Yeah !
Catchy , isn 't it ?
It 's one of my own compositions .
That 's not a song . It 's an abomination !
Abomination .
Mutations .
Deviations .
That 's all you 're gonna find down here .
Who would be so bold as to come armed into my kingdom ?
Spies ?
Thieves ?
Assassins ?
Dwarves , Your Malevolence .
Dwarves ?
We found them on the Front Porch .
Well , don 't just stand there .
Search them .
Every crack . Every crevice .
It is my belief ... your great protuberance , that they ... are in league with Elves !
Made in Rivendell . Ah .
Second Age .
Couldn 't give it away .
Just a couple of keepsakes .
What are you doing in these parts ?
Uh , don 't worry , lads .
I 'll handle this .
What 's ... ?
What 's that ?
No tricks .
I want the truth , warts and all .
You 're going to have to speak up .
Your boys flattened my trumpet .
I 'll flatten more than your trumpet !
If it 's more information you want , I 'm the one you should speak to .
Mm-hm .
We were on the road .
Well , it 's not so much a road as a path .
It 's not even that , come to think of it .
Anyway , the point is , we were on this road , like a path , like a track .
And then we weren 't , which is a problem , because we were ...
- supposed to be in Dunland ...
- Shut up .
Last Tuesday .
Visiting distant relations .
Some inbreds on me mother 's side .
Shut up !
If they will not talk , we 'll make them squawk .
Bring up the mangler .
Bring up the bonebreaker .
Start with the youngest .
Wait !
Well , well , well .
Look who it is .
Thorin , son of Thrain , son of Thror ...
King Under the Mountain .
Oh , but I 'm forgetting .
You don 't have a mountain .
And you 're not a king ... which makes you ... nobody , really .
I know someone who would pay a pretty price for your head .
Just a head .
Nothing attached .
Perhaps you know of whom I speak .
An old enemy of yours .
A pale Orc , astride a white Warg .
Azog the Defiler was destroyed .
He was slain in battle long ago .
So you think his defiling days are done , do you ?
Send word to the pale Orc .
Tell him I have found his prize .
Yes .
Yes .
Yes .
Yes !
Gollum , gollum !
Aah !
Nasty Goblinses !
Better than old bones , precious .
Better than nothing .
Too many boneses , precious .
Not enough flesh !
Shut up !
Cut it 's skin off .
Start with it 's head .
The cold hard lands They bites our hands .
They gnaws our feet .
The rocks and stones They 're like old bones .
All bare of meat .
Cold as death Without no breath .
It 's good to eat
Bless us and splash us ... precious .
That 's a meaty mouthful .
Gollum , gollum !
Aah .
Back .
Stay back .
I 'm warning you ... don 't come any closer .
It 's got an Elfish blade .
But it 's not an Elfs .
Not an Elfs , no .
What is it , precious ?
What is it ?
My name is Bilbo Baggins .
Bagginses ?
What is a Bagginses , precious ?
- I 'm a Hobbit from the Shire .
- Oh .
We like Goblinses , batses and fishes .
But we hasn 't tried Hobbitses before .
Is it soft ?
Is it juicy ?
Now , now ... keep your distance !
I 'll use this if I have to .
Aah !
I don 't want any trouble . Do you understand ?
Just show me the way to get out of here and I 'll be on my way .
Why ?
Is it lost ?
Yes .
Yes , and I want to get unlost as soon as possible .
Ooh , we knows !
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses .
Safe paths in ... the dark . Shut up !
I didn 't say anything .
We wasn 't talking to you .
Oh , yes , we was , precious .
We was .
Look , I don 't know what your game is ... but I ...
Games ?
Oh , we love games , doesn 't we , precious ?
Does it like games ?
Does it , does it ?
Does it like to play ?
Maybe .
What has roots as nobody sees ?
Is taller than trees ?
UP , up , up it goes .
And yet . Never grows .
The mountain .
Yes , yes .
Oh , let 's have another one , eh ?
Yes !
Do it again .
Do it again . Ask us .
No !
No more riddles .
Finish him off .
Finish him now !
Gollum , gollum !
No !
No .
No .
No .
I want to play .
I do .
I want to play .
I can see ... you are very good at this .
So why don 't we ... have a game of riddles ? Yes ? Just you and me .
Yes .
Yes , just us .
Yes .
Yes .
And if I win ... you show me the way out . Yes ?
Yes .
Yes .
And if it loses ?
What then ?
Well , if it loses , precious , then we eats it .
If Baggins loses , we eats it whole .
Fair enough .
Well , Baggins first .
Thirty white horses on a red hill .
First they champ .
Then they stamp .
Then they stand still .
Teeth ?
Teeth !
Oh , Yes . My precious !
But we ...
We ... only have nine .
Our turn .
Voiceless , it cries .
Wingless flutters .
Toothless bites .
Mouthless .
Mutters .
Just a minute .
Uh ...
Oh .
Oh !
We knows !
We knows !
Shut up !
Wind .
It 's wind .
Of course it is .
Very clever ...
Hobbitses .
Very clever .
Ah-ah-ah .
A box without hinges .
Key or lid .
Yet golden treasure .
Inside is hid .
Box .
Oh , um ...
Box .
The lid and a key .
Well ?
It 's nasty .
Box .
Key .
Do you give up ?
Give us a chance , precious !
Give us a chance !
Eggses !
Eggses !
Wet , crunchy ... little eggses .
Yes .
Grandmother taught us ... to suck them , yes !
We have one ... for you .
All things it devours .
Birds , beasts .
Trees , flowers .
Gnaws iron .
Bites steel .
Grinds hard stones to meal .
Answer us .
Give me a moment , please .
I gave you a good long while .
Birds , beasts ...
Beasts ?
Trees , flowers .
I don 't know this one .
Is it tasty ?
Is it scrumptious ?
Is it crunchable ?
Let me think .
Let me think .
It 's stuck .
Bagginses is stuck .
Time 's up .
Time .
The answer ... is time .
Actually it wasn 't that hard .
Last question .
Last chance .
Okay .
Ask us .
Ask us !
Yes , yes .
All right .
What have I got ... in my pocket ?
That 's no fair .
It 's against ... the rules !
Now ask us another one .
No . No , no , no .
You said ask me a question .
Well , that is my question .
What have I got in my pocket ?
It must give us ... three ! Three guesses , precious .
Three guesses .
Very well , guess away .
- Handses !
- Wrong .
Guess again .
Fishbones , Goblins ' teeth , wet shells , bats ' wings ...
Knife !
Oh , shut up !
Wrong again .
Last guess .
String .
Or nothing .
Two guesses at once .
Wrong both times .
So ...
Come , then .
I won the game .
You promised to show me the way out .
Did we say so , precious ?
Did we say so ?
What has it got in it 's pocketses ?
That 's no concern of yours .
You lost .
Lost ?
Lost ?
Lost ?
Where is it ?
No !
Where is it ? !
No !

Not it 's business !

Gollum !
What has it got ... in it 's nasty ... little pocketses ?
He stole it .
He stole it !
He stole it !
Bones will be shattered .
Necks will be wrung .
You 'll be beaten .
And battered From racks you 'll be hung .
You will die down here .
And never be .
Found .
Down in the deep .
Of Goblin-town
I know that sword !
It is the Goblin-cleaver !
The Biter !
The blade that sliced ... a thousand necks !
Slash them !

Bombur !
Go , go , go !
Jump !
Jump , lad !
Push !
Come on !
Come on !
Watch your backs !
You thought you could escape me .
What are you going to do now , Wizard ?
That 'll do it .
Well , that could have been worse .
Haver !
You 've got to be joking !
Gandalf !
There 's too many .
We can 't fight them .
Only one thing will save us , daylight !
Come on !
Here ! On your feet .
Balin .
Come on !
Wait !
My precious .

That 's 10 .
Fili , Kili !
That 's 12 .
And Bombur . That makes 13 .
Where 's Bilbo ?
Where is our Hobbit ?
Where is our Hobbit ?
Curse that Halfling !
Now he 's lost ?
I thought he was with Dori !
Don 't blame me !
Where did you last see him ?
I think I saw him ... slip away ... when they first collared us .
And what happened , exactly ?
- Tell me !
- I 'll tell you what happened .
Master Baggins saw his chance ... and he took it .
He has thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth ... since first he stepped out of his door .
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again .
He is long gone .
He isn 't .
Bilbo Baggins .
I have never been so glad ... to see anyone in my life .
Bilbo .
We 'd given you up .
How on earth did you get past the Goblins ?
How , indeed .
Well , what does it matter ?
He 's back .
It matters .
I want to know .
Why did you come back ?
Look , I know you doubt me . I know you always have .
And you 're right .
I often think of Bag-end .
I miss my books .
And my armchair and my garden .
See , that 's where I belong .
That 's home .
Because ... you don 't have one . And that 's why I came back .
A home .
It was taken from you .
But I will help you take it back if I can .
Out of the frying pan .
And into the fire .
Run .
Run !
Up into the trees !
All of you !
Climb !
Bilbo , climb !
Quickly !
They 're coming !
Hang on !
Hold on , brothers !
Azog .
It cannot be .
It 's going !
Fili !
Yeah !
No !
Oh , no .
Mr. Gandalf !
Oh , no , Dori !
Help !
No !
Thorin !
No !
Look .
Thorin !
Thorin !
Thorin .
The Halfling ?
It 's all right .
Bilbo is here .
He 's quite safe .
You !
What were you doing ?
You nearly got ... yourself killed !
Did I not say ... that you would be a burden ?
That you would not survive in the Wild ?
That you had no place amongst us ?
I have never been so wrong in all my life .
I am sorry I doubted you .
No , I would have doubted me too .
I 'm not a hero ... or a warrior .
Not even ... a burglar .
Is that what I think it is ?
Our home .
A raven !
The birds ... are returning to the mountain .
That , my dear Oin ... is a thrush .
But we 'll take it as a sign .
A good omen .
You 're right .
I do believe the worst is behind us .
( English
I 'm dying of thirst over here .
Come on !
Come on !
- Here you are .
Thank you kindly .
Oh , watch it !
MAN 3 : Sorry , darling .
- There you are .
- Thank you .
Master Stadle .
Mind if I join you ?
I 'll have the same .
I should introduce myself .
My name is Gandalf .
Gandalf the Grey .
I know who you are .
Well , now . This is a fine chance .
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree ?
I received word that my father had been seen wandering the Wilds near Dunland .
I went looking . I found no sign of him .
Thorin , it 's been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain .
He still lives .
I am sure of it .
My father came to see you before he went missing .
What did you say to him ?
I urged him to march upon Erebor , to rally the seven armies of the Dwarves to destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain .
And I would say the same to you .
Take back your homeland .
This is no chance meeting , is it , Gandalf ?
No .
It is not .
The Lonely Mountain troubles me Thorin .
That dragon has sat there long enough .
Sooner or later darker minds will turn towards Erebor .
I ran into some unsavory characters whilst traveling on the Greenway .
They mistook me for a vagabond .
I imagine they regretted that .
One of them was carrying a message .
It is Black Speech .
A promise of payment .
For what ?
Your head .
Someone wants you dead .
Thorin , you can wait no longer .
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin .
Unite the armies of the Dwarves .
Together , you have the might and power to retake Erebor .
Summon a meeting of the seven Dwarf families .
Demand they stand by their oath .
The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King 's Jewel .
The Arkenstone .
It is the only thing that will unite them , and in case you have forgotten that jewel was stolen by Smaug .
What if I were to help you reclaim it ?
How ?
The Arkenstone lies half a world away buried beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon .
Yes , it does .
Which is why we 're going to need a burglar .
How close is the pack ?
Too close .
A couple of leagues , no more .
But that 's not the worst of it .
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent ?
Not yet .
But they will do .
- We have another problem .
Did they see you ?
They saw you .
No , that 's not it .
What did I tell you ?
Quiet as a mouse .
Excellent burglar material .
Will you just listen ?
I 'm trying to tell you there is something else out there .
What form did it take ' ?
Like a bear ?
Ye
- Yes , but bigger .
Much bigger .
You knew about this beast ?
I say we double back .
And be run down by a pack of Ores ?
There is a house it 's not far from here , where we might take refuge .
Whose house ?
Are they friend or foe ?
Neither .
He will help us or he Will kill us .
What choice do we have ?
None .
Come on !
This way !
Quickly !
Run !
Bombur , come on !
To the house !
Run !
Come on , get inside .
Open the door !
Quickly !
Push !
Push !
Dwalin !
Come on , lads !
What is that ?
That is our host .
His name is Beorn .
And he 's a skin-changer .
Sometimes he 's a huge black bear . Sometimes he 's a great strong man .
The bear is unpredictable but the man can be reasoned with .
However he is not overfond of Dwarves .
He 's leaving .
Come away from there .
It 's not natural .
None of it .
It 's obvious .
He 's under some dark spell .
Don 't be a fool .
He 's under no enchantment but his own .
All right , now get some sleep . All of you .
You 'll be safe here tonight .
I hope .
So you are the one they call Oakenshield .
Tell me why is Azog the Defiler hunting you ?
You know of Azog ?
How ?
My people were the first to live in the mountains before the Ores came down from the North .
The Defiler killed most of my family .
But some he enslaved .
Not for work , you understand but for sport .
Caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him .
There are others like you ?
Once there were many .
And now ' ?
Now there is only one .
You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn .
Before Durin 's Day falls .
Yes .
You are running out of time .
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood .
A darkness lies upon that forest .
Fell things creep beneath those trees .
There is an alliance between the Ores of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur .
I would not venture there except in great need .
We will take the Elven Road .
That path is still safe .
Safe ?
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin .
They 're less wise and more dangerous .
But it matters not .
What do you mean ?
These lands are crawling with Orcs .
Their numbers are growing .
And you are on foot .
You will never reach the forest alive .
I don 't like Dwarves .
They 're greedy- - ... and blind .
Blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own .
But Ores I hate more .
What do you need ?
Go now .
While you have the light .
Your hunters are not far behind .
The Elven Gate .
Here lies our path through Mirkwood .
No sign of the Ores .
We have luck on our side .
Set the ponies loose .
Let them return to their master .
This forest feels sick .
As if a disease lies upon it .
Is there no way around ?
Not unless we go 200 miles north . Or twice that distance south .
Something moves in the shadows unseen hidden from our sight .
Every day it grows in strength .
Beware the Necromancer .
He is not what he seems .
If our Enemy has returned , we must know .
Go to the tombs in the mountains .
The High Fells .
So be it .
Not my horse !
Ineediﬂ
You 're not leaving us ?
I would not do this unless I had to .
You 've changed Bilbo Baggins .
You 're not the same Hobbit as the one who left the Shire .
I was going to tell you .
I found something in the Goblin tunnels .
Found what ?
What did you find ?
My courage .
Good .
Well , that 's good .
You 'll need it .
I 'll be waiting for you at the overlook , before the slopes of Erebor .
Keep the map and key safe .
Do not enter that mountain without me .
This is not the Greenwood of old .
The very air of the forest is heavy with illusion .
It 'll seek to enter your mind and lead you astray .
Lead us astray ?
What does that mean ?
You must stay on the path .
Do not leave it .
If you do , you 'll never find it again .
No matter what may come , stay on the path !
Come on .
We must reach the mountain before the sun sets on Durin 's Day .
Durin 's Day ?
Let 's go .
It is our one chance to find the hidden door .
The path turns this way .
This way .
Air . I need air .
My head , it 's swimming !
What 's happening ?
Keep moving .
Nori why have we stopped ?
The path it 's disappeared .
What 's going on ?
We 've lost the path !
Find it .
All of you , look .
Look for the path !
I don 't remember this bit .
None of it 's familiar .
It 's got to be here .
What hour is it ?
I do not know .
I do not even know what day it is .
ls there no end to this accursed forest ?
Attercop .
Look .
A tobacco pouch .
There 's Dwarves in these woods .
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains , no less .
This is exactly the same as mine .
Because it is yours .
Do you understand ?
We 're going around in circles .
We are lost .
We are not lost .
We keep heading east .
But which way is east ?
We 've lost the sun .
I thought you were the expert .
The sun .
We have to find the sun .
Up there .
We need to get above the canopy .
What was that ?
Enough ! Quiet !
All of you !
We 're being watched .
I can see a lake !
And a river .
And the Lonely Mountain .
We 're almost there !
Can you hear me ?
I know which way to go !
Hello ?
Hello .
Oh , no .
Oh , come on .
Kill them !
Kill them .
Eat them now , while their blood is running .
Their hide is tough , but there 's good juice inside .
Stick it again .
Stick it again .
Finish it off .
The meat 's alive and kicking !
Kill him .
Kill him now .
Let us feast .
Feast !
Feast !
Feast !
Feast !
Eat them alive !
Feast !
What is it ?
What is it ?
Eat them alive !
Fat and juicy .
Just a little taste .
Curse it !
Where is it ? !
Where is it ?
Here .
Ah !
It stings !
It stings !
Sting .
That 's a good name .
Sting .
You all right there , Bofur ?
I 'm all right !
Get it off me !
Where 's Bilbo ?
I 'm up here !
Grab the legs !
Pull !
Pull !
Where is it ?
Where is it ?
Come on .
Where is it ?
No !
No !
No !
Thorin !
Get them !
Come on !
Look out , brother !
Fili !
Mine .
Come on keep up !
We 're clear !
Do not think I won 't kill you , Dwarf .
It would be my pleasure .
Help !
- Kili !
Throw me a dagger !
Quick !
If you think I 'm giving you a weapon , Dwarf you 're mistaken !
Search them .
B 'ey !
Give it back !
That 's private !
Who is this ?
That is ... mm ) ' Wife ! - Your brother ?
And what is this horrid creature ?
A Goblin-mutant ?
That 's my wee lad , Gimli .
Where did you get this ?
It was given to me .
Not just a thief , but a liar as well .
Thorin , where 's Bilbo ?
Unh ! This is not the end of it !
- Do you hear me ? !
Hey , let us out of here !
Get off me !
Aren 't you going to search me ?
I could have anything down my trousers .
Or nothing .
Leave it !
There 's no way out !
This is no Orc dungeon .
These are the Halls of the Woodland Realm .
No one leaves here but by the king 's consent .
Some may imagine that a noble quest is at hand .
A quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon .
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive .
Attempted burglary . Or something of that ilk .
You have found a way in .
You seek that which would bestow upon you the right to rule .
The King 's Jewel .
The Arkenstone .
It is precious to you beyond measure .
I understand that .
There are gems in the mountain that I too desire .
White gems of pure starlight .
I offer you my help .
I am listening .
I will let you go if you but return what is mine .
A favor for a favor .
You have my word .
One king to another .
I would not trust Thranduil the great king to honor his word should the end of all days be upon us !
You who lack all ... . honoﬂ
I have seen how you treat your friends .
We came to you once , starving , homeless seeking your help .
But you turned your back !
You turned away from the suffering of my people and the inferno that destroyed us .
Do not talk to me of dragon fire .
I know its wrath and ruin .
I have faced the great serpents of the North .
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon .
But he would not listen .
You are just like him .
Stay here if you will and rot .
A hundred years is a mere blink in the life of an Elf .
I 'm patient .
I can wait .
Did he offer you a deal ?
He did .
I told him he could go ish kakhfé ai - ' d dEIr-rugnu !
Him and all his kin !
Well , that 's that , then .
A deal was our only hope .
Not our only hope .
I know you 're there .
Why do you linger in the shadows ?
I was coming to report to you .
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not two moons past .
We cleared the forest as ordered , my lord . But more spiders keep ...
They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur .
If we could kill them at their source ...
That fortress lies beyond our borders .
Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures .
That is your task .
And when we drive them off , what then ?
Will they not spread to other lands ?
Other lands are not my concern .
The fortunes of the world will rise and fall .
But here in this kingdom , we will endure .
Legolas said you fought well today .
He has grown very fond of you .
I assure you , my lord Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard .
Perhaps he did once .
Now I am not so sure .
I do not think you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf .
No , you are right . I would not .
Still , he cares about you .
Do not give him hope where there is none .
The stone in your hand , what is it ?
It is a talisman .
A powerful spell lies upon it .
If any but a Dwarf reads the runes on this stone they will be forever cursed .
Or not .
Depending on whether you believe in that kind of thing .
It 's just a token .
A rune stone .
My mother gave it to me so I 'd remember my promise .
What promise ?
That I would come back to her .
She worries .
She thinks I 'm reckless .
Are you ?
Nah .
Sounds like quite a party you 're having up there .
It is Mereth e-nGilith the Feast of Starlight .
All light is sacred to the Eldar .
But Wood Elves love best the light of the stars .
I always thought it is a cold light .
Remote and far away .
It is memory precious and pure .
Like your promise .
I have walked there sometimes .
Beyond the forest and up into the night .
I have seen the world fall away and the white light of forever fill the air .
I saw a fire moon once .
It rose over the pass near Dunland .
Huge .
Red and gold , it was . It filled the sky .
We were an escort for some merchants from Ered Luin .
They were trading in silverwork for furs .
We took the Greenway south keeping the mountain to our left .
And then it appeared .
This huge fire moon lighting our path .
I wish I could show you the caverns .
Galion , you old rogue , we 're running out of drink .
These empty barrels should have been sent back to Esgaroth hours ago .
The bargeman will be waiting for them .
He has excellent taste in wine .
Come , Elros , try it .
I have the Dwarves in my charge .
They 're locked up .
Where can they go ?
Ha , ha .
I 'll wager the sun is on the rise .
Must be nearly dawn .
We 're never gonna reach the mountain , are we ?
Not stuck in here , you 're not .
Bilbo !
What ?
Shh !
There are guards nearby !
- Ha , ha , ha .
Close the doors .
- It 'll buy us more time .
- All right , Nori .
Up the stairs .
You first .
Ori .
Not that way .
Down here .
Follow me .
Go .
Easy , now .
This way .
Come on .
I don 't believe it .
We 're in the cellars !
You were supposed to be leading us out , not further in !
I know what I 'm doing !
Shh !
This way !
This way !
Everyone climb into the barrels quickly .
Are you mad ?
- They 'll find us .
No , no .
They won 't , I promise you .
Please , please . You must trust me .
Do as he says .
Move your big ginger head .
Bifur , get in the barrel !
Move !
Everyone 's in .
What do we do now ?
Hold your breath .
Hold my breath ?
What do you mean ?
Where is the Keeper of the Keys ?
Well done , Master Baggins .
Go !
Come on , let 's go !
Hold on !
Bilbo !
Hang on !
Help !
Ori !
No !
Watch out !
There 's Ores !
Get under the bridge !
Kili !
Kili !
Kili .
Kili !
Nori !
Cut the log !
Bombu r !
Tauriel .
Oh , it 's you !
Why am I here , Gandalf ?
Trust me , Radagast .
I would not have called you here without good reason .
This is not a nice place to meet .
No . It is not .
These are dark spells , Gandalf .
Old and full of hate .
Who 's buried here ?
If he had a name , it 's long since been lost .
He would have been known only as a servant of evil .
One of a number .
One of nine .
Why now , Gandalf ?
I don 't understand .
The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur .
But it cannot be the Necromancer .
A human sorcerer could not summon such evil .
Who said it was human ?
The Nine only answer to one master .
We 've been blind , Radagast .
And in our blindness the Enemy has returned .
He is summoning his servants .
Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter .
He is a commander .
A commander of legions .
The Enemy is preparing for war .
It will begin in the East .
His mind is set upon that mountain .
- Where are you going ?
- To rejoin the others .
Gandalf .
I started this .
I cannot forsake them .
They are in grave danger .
If what you say is true the world is in grave danger .
The power in that fortress will only grow stronger .
You want me to cast my friends aside ?
Anything behind us ?
Not that I can see .
I think we 've outrun the Ores .
We 've lost the current .
Bombur 's half drowned .
- Make for the shore !
- Aye .
Come on , let 's go !
Gloin , help me , my brother .
Come on , lift yourself .
Come on !
Come on , you big lump , you !
I 'm fine . It 's nothing .
On your feet .
Kilt 's wounded .
His leg needs binding .
There 's an Orc pack on our tail .
We keep moving .
To where ?
To the mountain .
We 're so close .
A lake lies between us and that mountain .
- We have no way to cross it .
- So then we go around .
The Orcs will run us down , as sure as daylight .
We 've no weapons to defend ourselves .
Bind his leg , quickly .
You have two minutes .
Do it again and you 're dead .
Excuse me but you 're from Lake-town , if I 'm not mistaken .
That barge over there it wouldn 't be available for hire , by any chance ?
What makes you think I would help you ?
Those boots have seen better days .
As has that coat .
No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed .
How many bairns ?
A boy and two girls .
And your wife , I imagine she 's a beauty .
Aye .
She was .
I 'm sorry .
I didn 't mean to
Oh , come on , come on .
Enough of the niceties .
What 's your hurry ?
What 's it to you ?
I would like to know who you are and what you are doing in these lands .
We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills .
Simple merchants , you say ?
We need food supplies , weapons .
Can you help us ?
I know where these barrels came from .
What of it ' ?
I don 't know what business you had with the Elves but I don 't think it ended well .
No one enters Lake-town but by leave of the Master .
All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland Realm .
He would see you in irons before risking the wrath of King Thranduil .
Offer him more .
I 'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen .
Aye .
But for that you would need a smuggler .
For which we would pay double .
Such is the nature of evil .
Out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads .
A shadow that grows in the dark .
A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night .
So it ever was .
So will it always be .
In time , all foul things come forth .
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves .
Why ?
Not 13 .
Not anymore .
The young one the black-haired archer we stuck him with a Morgul shaft .
The poison 's in his blood .
He 'll be choking on it soon .
Answer the question , filth .
I would not antagonize her .
You like killing things , Orc ?
You like death ?
Then let me give it to you .
I do not care about one dead Dwarf .
Answer the question .
You have nothing to fear .
Tell us what you know and I will set you free .
You had orders to kill them .
Why ?
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you ?
The Dwarf runt will never be king .
King ?
There is no King Under the Mountain , nor will there ever be .
None would dare enter Erebor whilst the dragon lives .
You know nothing .
Your world will burn .
What are you talking about ?
Speak !
Our time has come again .
My master serves the One .
Do you understand now , Elf ling ?
Death is upon you .
The flames of war are upon you .
Why did you do that ?
You promised to set him free .
And I did .
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders .
There was more the Orc could tell us .
There was nothing more he could tell me .
What did he mean by the flames of war ?
It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it .
I want the watch doubled at our borders .
All roads , all rivers .
Nothing moves , but I hear of it .
No one enters this kingdom .
And no one leaves it .
Watch out !
I was born and bred on these waters , Master Dwarf .
If I wanted to drown you I would not do it here .
Oh , I 've had enough of this lippy Lakeman .
I say we throw him over the side and be done with it .
- Bard , his name 's Bard .
How do you know ?
Uh , I asked him .
I don 't care what he calls himself .
I don 't like him .
We do not have to like him .
We simply have to pay him .
Come on now , lads .
Turn out your pockets .
How do we know he won 't betray us ?
We don 't .
We 're 10 coins short .
Gloin .
Come on .
- Give us what you have .
- Don 't look to me .
I have been bled dry by this venture .
What have I seen for my investment ?
Naught but misery and grief and
Bless my beard .
Take it .
- Take all of it .
- Ahem .
The money , quick .
Give it to me . We will pay you when we get our provisions but not before .
If you value your freedom , you 'll do as I say .
There are guards ahead .
What 's he doing ?
He 's talking to someone .
He 's pointing right at us .
Now they 're shaking hands .
- What ?
The villain .
He 's selling us out .
Quiet .
We 're approaching the tollgate .
Halt !
Goods inspection !
Papers , please !
Oh , it 's you , Bard .
Morning , Percy .
Anything to declare ?
Nothing , but that I am cold and tired and ready for home .
You and me both .
There we are .
All in order .
Not so fast .
Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm .
Only they 're not empty are they , Bard ?
If I recall correctly you 're licensed as a bargeman .
Not a fisherman .
That 's none of your business .
Wrong .
It 's the Master 's business , which makes it my business .
Oh , come on , Alfrid , have a heart .
People need to eat .
These fish are illegal .
Empty the barrels ...
- ... over the side .
- You heard him .
In the canal .
Come on .
Get a move on .
Folk in this town are struggling .
Times are hard .
And when the people hear the Master is dumping fish back in the lake when the rioting starts will it be your problem then ? Food is scarce .
That 's not my problem .
Stop .
Ever the people 's champion eh , Bard ?
Protector of the common folk .
You might have their favor now , bargeman but it won 't last .
Raise the gate !
The Master has his eye on you .
You 'd do well to remember :
We know where you live .
It 's a small town , Alfrid .
Everyone knows where everyone lives .
All this talk of civil unrest .
Someone 's been stirring the pot , sire .
Gout playing up , sire ?
It 's the damp . It 's the only possible explanation .
Get me a brandy .
The mood of the people , sire , it 's turning ugly .
They 're commoners , Alfrid . They 've always been ugly .
It 's not my fault they live in a place that stinks of fish oil and tar .
Jobs , shelter , food .
It 's all they ever bleat about .
It 's my belief , sire , they are being led on by troublemakers .
Then we must find these troublemakers and arrest them .
My thoughts exactly , sire .
And all this talk of change must be suppressed .
Can 't afford to let the rabble band together and start making noises .
The next thing you know , they 'll start asking questions forming committees launching inquiries .
Out with the old , in with the new ?
What ?
That 's what they 've been saying , sire .
There is even talk of an election .
An election ? Heh .
That 's absurd .
I won 't stand for it . Ha !
I don 't think they 'd ask you to stand , sire .
Shirkers .
Ingrates .
Rabble-rousers .
Who would have the nerve to question my authority ?
Who would dare ?
Who- - ?
Bard .
You mark my words :
That trouble-making bargeman is behind all this .
Get your hands off me .
You didn 't see them .
They were never here .
The fish you can have for nothing .
Follow me .
Da !
Our house , it 's being watched .
You can tell the Master I 'm done for the day .
Da !
Where have you been ?
Father !
There you are !
I was worried .
Here , Sigrid .
Bah , get them ' m .
If you speak of this to anyone I 'll rip your arms off .
Get off .
Up there .
Da why are there Dwarves climbing out of our toilet ?
Will they bring us luck ?
They may not be the best fit but they 'll keep you warm .
Thank you very much .
A Dwarvish windlance .
You look like you 've seen a ghost .
He has .
The last time we saw such a weapon a city was on fire .
It was the day the dragon came .
The day that Smaug destroyed Dale .
Girion , the Lord of the City rallied his bowmen to fire upon the beast .
But a dragon 's hide is tough .
Tougher than the strongest armor .
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance could have pierced the dragon 's hide .
And few of those arrows were ever made .
The store was running low when Girion made his last stand .
Had the aim of Men been true that day much would have been different .
You speak as if you were there .
All Dwarves know the tale .
Then you would know that Girion hit the dragon .
He loosened a scale under the left wing .
One more shot and he would have killed the beast .
That 's a fairy story , lad .
Nothing more .
You took our money .
Where are the weapons ?
Wait here .
Tomorrow begins the last days of autumn .
Durin 's Day falls the morn after next .
We must reach the mountain before then .
And if we do not ?
If we fail to find the hidden door before that time ?
Then this quest has been for nothing .
What is this ?
Pike hook .
Made from an old harpoon .
- And this ?
A crowbill , we call it .
Fashioned from a smithy 's hammer .
It 's heavy in hand , I grant but in defense of your life , these will serve you better than none .
We paid you for weapons .
Iron-forged swords and axes !
It 's a joke !
You won 't find better outside the city armory .
All iron-forged weapons are held there under lock and key .
Thorin why not take what 's on offer and go ?
I 've made do with less . So have you .
- I say we leave now .
- You 're not going anywhere .
What did you say ?
There are spies watching this house and probably every dock and wharf in the town .
You must wait till nightfall .
Thorin .
Da ?
Don 't let them leave .
Tauriel you cannot hunt 30 Orcs on your own .
But I 'm not on my own .
You knew I would come .
The king is angry Tauriel .
For 600 years my father has protected you , favored you .
You defied his orders .
You betrayed his trust .
The king has never let Orc filth roam our lands .
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners .
It is not our fight .
It is our fight .
It will not end here .
With every victory , this evil will grow .
If your father has his way , we will do nothing .
We will hide within our walls live our lives away from the light and let darkness descend .
Are we not part of this world ?
Tell me , mellon .
When did we let evil become stronger than us ?
Hello , Bard .
What you after ?
There was a tapestry !
An old one !
Where 's it gone ?
What tapestry you talking about ?
This one .
They were Dwarves , I tell you .
Appeared out of nowhere .
Full beards . Fierce eyes .
I 've never seen the like .
What are Dwarves doing in these parts ?
- It 's the prophecy .
The prophecy ?
The Prophecy of Durin 's Folk .
Prophecy .
Prophecy .
The old tales will come true .
Vast halls of treasure !
Can it really be true ?
Has the lord of silver fountains returned ?
The lord of the silver fountains
The King of carven stone
The King beneath the mountain
Shall come into his own !
And the bell shall ring in gladness
At the Mountain
King 's return
But all shall fail in sadness
And the lake will shine and burn
Da , I tried to stop them .
How long have they been gone ?
Can you see anything ?
Shh ! Keep it down .
As soon as we have the weapons , we make straight for the mountain .
GO , go !
Go , Nori .
Next .
You all right ?
I can manage .
Let 's just get out of here .
Run !
Quickly ! Move now !
Get off me ! Get off !
Move them along here .
Move on !
What is the meaning of this ?
We caught them stealing weapons , sire . MASTER : Ah .
Enemies of the state , eh ?
A desperate bunch of mercenaries , if ever there was , sire .
Hold your tongue !
You do not know to whom you speak .
This is no common criminal .
This is Thorin son of Thrain , son of Thror !
We are the Dwarves of Erebor .
We have come to reclaim our homeland .
I remember this town in the great days of old .
Fleets of boats lay at harbor filled with silks and fine gems .
This was no forsaken town on a lake .
This was the center of all trade in the North !
I would see those days return .
I would relight the great forges of the Dwarves and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the Halls of Erebor !
Death !
That is what you will bring upon us !
Dragon fire and ruin .
If you waken that beast it will destroy us all .
You can listen to this naysayer but I promise you this :
If we succeed all will share in the wealth of the mountain .
You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times over !
All of you !
Listen to me !
You must listen !
Have you forgotten what happened to Dale ?
Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm ? !
And for what purpose ?
The blind ambition of a Mountain King so riven by greed , he could not see beyond his own desire !
Now , now !
We must not , any of us be too quick to lay blame .
Let us not forget that it was Girion , Lord of Dale your ancestor who failed to kill the beast !
It 's true , sire .
We all know the story .
Arrow after arrow , he shot .
Each one missing its mark .
You have no right .
No right to enter that mountain .
I have the only right .
I speak to the Master of the Men of the Lake .
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled ?
Will you share in the great wealth of our people ?
What say you ?
I say unto you ...
Welcome !
Welcome !
And thrice welcome King Under the Mountain !
You do know we 're one short .
Where 's Bofur ?
- If he 's not here , we leave him behind .
- We 'll have to .
If we 're to find the door before nightfall , we can risk no more delays .
Not you .
We must travel at speed .
You will slow us down .
What are you talking about ?
I 'm coming with you .
Not now .
I 'm going to be there when that door is opened .
When we first look upon the Halls of our Fathers , Thorin .
Kili , stay here .
Rest .
Join us when you 're healed .
I 'll stay with the lad .
My duty lies with the wounded .
Uncle .
We grew up on tales of the mountain .
Tales you told us .
You cannot take that away ...
- ... from him !
- Fili .
I will carry him if I must !
One day you will be king and you will understand .
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one Dwarf .
Not even my own kin .
Fili , don 't be a fool .
You belong with the company .
I belong with my brother .
By my beard , is that the time ? !
Ah !
Go now with our goodwill and good wishes .
- And may your return bring good fortune ...
Wait !
... to all !
Good bye .
Out of the way !
No ! No !
Ha .
So you missed the boat as well ?
Kili ?
Kili !
No .
I 'm done with Dwarves .
Go away .
No , no no !
Please !
No one will help us .
Kilt 's sick .
He 's very sick .
What is this place ?
It was once the city of Dale .
Now it is a ruin .
The desolation of Smaug .
The sun will soon reach midday .
We must find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets .
This way .
Wait .
Is this the overlook ?
Gandalf said to meet him here .
- On no account were we to
- Do you see him ?
We have no time to wait upon the Wizard .
We 're on our own .
Come !
Dol Guldur .
The Hill of Sorcery .
It looks completely abandoned .
As it is meant to .
A spell of concealment lies over this place , which means our Enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself .
He has not regained his full strength .
Radagast , I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel .
Tell her we must force his hand .
What do you mean ?
I 'm going in alone .
On no account come after me .
Do I have your word ?
Yes , yes , yes !
Wait , Gandalf !
What if it 's a trap ? !
Turn around and do not come back .
It 's undoubtedly a trap .
Anything ?
Nothing !
If the map is true then the hidden door lies directly above us .
Up here !
You have keen eyes , Master Baggins .
This must be it .
The hidden door .
Let all those who doubted us rue this day !
Right , then .
We have a key .
Which means that somewhere there is a key-hole .
The last light of Durin 's Day will shine upon the key-hole .
Nori .
We 're losing the light .
Come on .
Be quiet !
I can 't hear when you 're thumping .
I can 't find it .
It 's not here !
It 's not here !
Break it down !
Aye .
Come on !
Break !
It has to break .
It 's no good .
The door 's sealed .
Can 't be opened by force .
There 's a powerful magic on it .
No !
The last light of Durin 's Day will shine upon the key-hole .
That is what it says .
What did we miss ?
What did we miss ?
Balin ?
We 've lost the light .
There 's no more to be done .
We had but one chance .
Come away , lads .
It 's over .
- Wait a minute .
We 're too late .
Where are they going ?
You can 't give up now !
Thorin .
You can 't give up now .
Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks .
The setting sun . And the last light of Durin 's Day will shine ...
The last light .
Last light .
The last light !
The key-hole !
Come back !
Come back !
It 's the light of the moon !
The last moon of autumn !
Ha , ha , ha !
Where 's the key ? Where 's the key ?
Where 's the- - ?
It was here .
Come on , it was
- It was here .
It was just
Erebor .
Thorin .
I know these walls .
These halls .
This stone .
You remember it Balin .
Chambers filled with golden light .
I remember .
Herein lies the Seventh Kingdom of Durin 's Folk .
May the Heart of the Mountain unite all Dwarves in defense of this home .
The Throne of the King .
Ah .
And what 's that above it ?
The Arkenstone .
Arkenstone .
And what 's that ?
That , Master Burglar is why you are here .
Can you not do something ?
I need herbs .
Something to bring down his fever .
I have nightshade .
I have feverfew .
They 're no use to me .
Do you have any kingsfoil ?
No , it 's a weed .
We feed it to the pigs .
Pigs ?
Weed .
Right .
Don 't move .
You want me to find a jewel ?
A large , white jewel .
Yes .
That 's it ?
Only , I imagine there 's quite a few down there .
There is only one Arkenstone and you 'll know it when you see it .
Right .
In truth lad I do not know what you will find down there .
You needn 't go if you don 't want to .
There 's no dishonor in turning back .
No , Balin .
I promised I would do this and I think I must try .
It never ceases to amaze me .
What 's that ?
The courage of Hobbits .
Go now with as much luck as you can muster .
Oh , Bilbo ?
If there is , in fact a live dragon down there don 't waken it .
Where is your master ?
Where is he ?
Sauron !
Hello ?
He 's not at home .
Not at home .
Ahem .
Good .
Good , good , good .
What 's that ?
Shush.Shush.
Arkenstone .
Arkenstone .
A large , white jewel .
Very helpful .
Well thief .
I smell you .
I hear your breath .
I feel your air .
Where are you ?
Where are you ?
Come , now don 't be shy .
Step into the light .
Hmm .
There is something about you .
Something you carry .
Something made of gold .
But far more precious .
Precious !
Precious !
There you are Thief in the Shadows .
I did not come to steal from you O Smaug the Unassessably Wealthy .
I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence .
To see if you really were as great as the old tales say .
I did not believe them .
And do you now ' ?
Truly the tales and songs fall utterly short of your enormity O Smaug the Stupendous .
Do you think flattery will keep you alive ?
No , no .
No , indeed .
You seem familiar with my name but I don 't remember smelling your kind before .
Who are you and where do you come from may I ask ?
I come from under the hill .
Underhill ?
And under hills and over hills my path has led .
And
- And through the air .
I am he who walks unseen .
Impressive .
What else do you claim to be ?
I am
Luck-wearer .
Riddle-maker .
Lovely titles .
Go on .
Barrel-rider .
Barrels ?
Now that is interesting .
And what about your little Dwarf friends ?
Where are they hiding ?
Dwarves ?
No .
No , no .
No Dwarves here .
You 've got that all wrong .
Oh , I don 't think so , Barrel-rider !
They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside .
Truly you are mistaken O Smaug , Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities .
You have nice manners for a thief and a liar !
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf .
No one better !
It is the gold !
They are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh .
Did you think I did not know this day would come ?
That a pack of canting Dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain ? !
Was that an earthquake ?
That , my lad was a dragon .
Da ?
It 's coming from the mountain .
You should leave us .
Take your children .
Get out of here .
And go where ?
There is nowhere to go .
Are we going to die , Da ?
No , darling .
The dragon .
It 's going to kill us .
Not if I kill it first .
The King Under the Mountain is dead .
I took his throne . I ate his people like a wolf among sheep .
I kill where I wish , when I Wish .
My armor is iron .
No blade can pierce me .
All right .
A Black Arrow ?
Why did you never tell me ' ?
Because you did not need to know .
Listen to me carefully .
I need you to distract the guards .
Once I 'm at the top of the tower , I 'll set the arrow to the bow .
There he is !
Bard !
- After him !
- Quickly !
Down there .
Go !
Stop him !
Stop him !
Stop !
Bain !
Bain .
Keep it safe .
Don 't let anyone find it .
I 'll deal with them .
- I 'm not leaving you .
- Now go !
Braga .
You 're under arrest .
- On what charge ?
- Any charge the Master chooses .
Where 's he gone ?
What about Bilbo ?
Give him more time .
Time to do what ?
To be killed ?
You 're afraid .
Yes , I 'm afraid .
I fear for you .
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard .
A sickness which drove your grandfather mad .
I am not my grandfather .
You 're not yourself .
The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there
I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar .
Bilbo .
His name is Bilbo .
It 's Oakenshield that filthy Dwarvish usurper .
He sent you in here for the Arkenstone , didn 't he ?
No . No no .
I don 't know what you 're talking about .
Don 't bother denying it .
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago .
But it matters not .
Oakenshield 's quest will fail .
The darkness is coming .
It will spread to every corner of the land .
You were only ever a means to an end .
The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found it worth nothing .
No .
No .
No , you 're lying .
What did he promise you ?
A share of the treasure ?
As if it was his to give .
I will not part with a single coin .
Not one piece of it .
My teeth are swords .
My claws are spears .
My Wings are a hurricane .
So it is true .
The Black Arrow found its mark .
What did you say ?
I was just saying your reputation precedes you , O Smaug the Tyrannical .
Truly . You have no equal on this earth .
I am almost tempted to let you take it .
If only to see Oakenshield suffer .
Watch it destroy him .
Watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad .
But I think not .
I think our little game ends here .
So tell me thief how do you choose to die ?
Nah .
Da ?
Is that you , Da ?
- Aah !
Stay down !
Get down !
You killed them all .
There are others .
Tauriel .
Come .
We 're losing him .
Tauriel .
Athens .
Athens .
What are you doing ?
I 'm going to save him .
- You 're alive !
- Not for much longer .
- Did you find the Arkenstone ?
The Arkenstone .
- The dragon 's coming .
Did you find it ?
We have to get out .
Thorin .
Thorin .
You will burn !
- Run !
- Ah !
Come on , Bilbo !
Come on .
Hold him down .
Unh !
Tilda .
Shh , Shh , Shh !
We 've given him the slip .
No .
He 's too cunning for that .
So where to now ?
The western guardroom .
There may be a way out .
It 's too high .
There 's no chance ...
- ... that way .
- It 's our only chance .
We have to try .
Come on .
I 've heard tell of the wonders of Elvish medicine .
That was a privilege to witness .
Tauriel .
Lie still .
You cannot be her .
She is far away .
She is far far away from me .
She walks in starlight in another world .
It was just a dream .
Do you think she could 've loved me ?
Stay close .
That 's it , then .
There 's no way out .
The last of our kin .
They must have come here hoping beyond hope .
We could try to reach the mines .
We might last a few days .
No .
I will not die like this .
Cowering .
Clawing for breath .
We make for the forges .
He 'll see us , sure as death .
Not if we split up .
Thorin we 'll never make it .
Some of us might .
Lead him to the forges .
We kill the dragon .
If this is to end in fire then we will all burn together .
This way .
Flee .
Flee .
Run for your lives .
There is nowhere to hide .
Behind you !
Worm !
Come on !
Run !
Hey , you !
Here !
This way .
It 's this way !
Come on !
Thofin !
Follow Balin !
- Thorin .
- Come on !
Thofin !
Hold on !
Thofin !
Go .
Go !
The plan 's not gonna work .
These furnaces are stone cold .
He 's right .
We 've no fire hot enough to set them ablaze .
Have we not ?
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted .
You have grown slow and fat in your dotage slug !
Take cover .
Go !
Bombu r !
Get those bellows working .
Go !
Bilbo !
Up there .
On my mark pull that lever .
Balin !
Can you still mix a flash-flame ?
Aye .
It 'll only take a jiffy .
Come on !
We don 't have a jiffy .
Where 's the sulfur ?
You sure you know what you 're doing ?
Come on !
NOW !
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings .
Keep going , Bilbo !
Run !
You think you can deceive me , Barrel-rider ?
You have come from Lake-town .
This is some sordid scheme hatched between these filthy Dwarves and those miserable tub-trading Lakemen .
Those sniveling cowards with their long bows and Black Arrows .
Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit .
Oh , no .
This isn 't their fault !
Wait !
You cannot go to Lake-town !
You care about them ... you ?
Good .
Then you can watch them die .
Here !
You witless worm .
You .
I am taking back what you stole .
You will take nothing from me Dwarf .
I laid low your warriors of old .
I instilled terror in the hearts of Men .
I am King Under the Mountain .
This is not your kingdom .
These are Dwarf lands .
This is Dwarf gold .
And we will have our revenge .
Revenge ?
Revenge ?
I will show you revenge !
Listen to me !
Do you not know what is coming ?
I am fire .
I am death .
What have we done ?
I warned you .
Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with Dwarves ?
Now they 've done it .
They 've woken the dragon ! They 've brought an apocalypse upon our heads !
Come on . Quickly .
Quickly .
Faster now ...
I 'm trying to evacuate .
Careful , man .
Never mind the books .
Get on !
But , sire , should we not try to save the town ?
The town is lost .
- Save the gold !
You heard him .
Get a move on .
Da !
Come on .
Pile them up !
We have no time .
We must leave .
Get him up .
Come on .
- Come on .
Let 's go .
- I 'm fine .
I can walk .
- Fast as you can .
- We 're not leaving .
Not without our father .
If you stay here , your sisters will die .
Is that what your father would want ?
Open ... this door !
Do you hear me ?
I can see him !
Look !
Down here !
Now !
Give me your hand .
We gotta go .
Quickly now .
Hurry .
Kili , come on !
It 's around the corner !
Keep on going , man !
Dragon !
Come on , come on !
Faster !
Faster !
If only we could take ... more of these people with us , but they 're hardly ...
- Worth it .
I quite agree .
Help !
Help !
Look out !
Move it !
Move it !
Come on !
Faster !
My gold !
My gold !
We 're carrying too much .
We need to dump something .
Quite right ...
Alfrid .
Faster !
Faster !
Poor souls .
Da .
Da !
He hit it !
- He hit the dragon ! He did !
- No .
He hit his mark !
I saw .
His arrows cannot Pierce its hide .
I fear nothing will .
What are you doing ?
Come back !
Bain !
Bain !
Bain !
Get back here !
Bain !
Leave him .
We cannot go back .
Bain !
Dad .
Bain !
What are you doing ?
You were supposed to leave !
- I came to help you .
- No !
Nothing can stop it now .
This might .
Bain .
You go back .
You get out of here .
Now .
Dad !
No !
Stop , stop !
Halt !
Halt !
Who are you ... that would stand ... against me ?
Now , that is a pity .
What will you do now ...
Bowman ?
You are ... forsaken .
No help will come .
Now 's our chance !
Go !
Go !
Head for the open water !
Hmm .
Is that ... your child ?
You cannot ... save him from the fire .
He will ... burn !
Stay still , son .
Stay still .
Tell me ... wretch ... how now shall you challenge me ?
You have nothing left ... but your ... death !
Bain .
Look at me .
You look at me .
Little to your left .
That 's it .
Bain !
Hold on !
What was that ?
What happened ?
It fell .
I saw it .
It 's dead .
Smaug is dead .
By my beard ... I think he 's right .
Look there !
The Ravens of Erebor are returning to the Mountain .
Aye .
Word will spread .
Before long ... every soul in Middle-earth will know ... the dragon is dead !
You are not ... alone ...
Mithrandir .
Help me !
Where 's my baby ?
Please !
Somebody help me !
Help !
Over there !
Da !
Da !
Da !
- Da !
Aah !
Why me ?
Tauriel .
Kili !
Come on .
We 're leaving !
They are your people .
You must go .
Come with me .
I know how I feel .
I 'm not afraid .
You make me feel alive .
I can 't .
Tauriel .
I don 't know what that means .
I think you do .
One more !
Keep it .
As a promise .
These are dry .
You 'll need them .
Thank you .
- Here .
Oi ! Give me one of them .
I 'll catch my death ... in this cold .
Find your own !
You 're not in charge , Alfrid Lickspittle .
You are wrong .
In the absence of the Master ... the power cedes to his deputy ... which in this instance is my good self .
Now give me that blanket !
Master 's deputy ?
Don 't make me laugh .
You 're a sneak-thief .
I 'll be dead before ... I answer to you .
Maybe that can be arranged .
I wouldn 't go turning on your own , Alfrid .
Not now .
- Da !
- Come here !
You 're alive .
It 's all right , darling .
It was Bard !
He killed the dragon !
I saw it with me own eyes .
He brought the beast down !
Shot him dead ... with a Black Arrow .
Thank you , Bard !
Good man .
Thank you !
You 've saved us all !
Bless you .
All hail to the Dragon-Slayer !
All hail ... King Bard !
I have said it many times .
This is a man of noble stock .
- A born leader !
Do not call me that .
I 'm not Master ... of this town .
Where is he ?
- Where 's the Master ?
Halfway down the Anduin .
With all our coin , I don 't doubt .
You would know .
You helped him empty ...
- the treasury .
- No .
I tried to stop him .
Liar !
- Cheat !
You 're a mongrel !
I begged .
I pleaded .
Away with him !
Tar him !
Think of the children .
Hang him !
Will nobody think of the children ?
Ow !
To the tree with him !
Hang him hard !
Take him down !
Enough !
Let him go !
Let him go !
Look around you !
Have you not ... had your fill of death ?
Winter is upon us .
We must look to our own .
To the sick and the helpless .
Those who can stand , tend to the wounded .
Those who have strength , follow me .
We must salvage what we can .
What then ?
What 'll we do then ?
We find shelter .
Hello !
Bombur ?
Bifur ?
Anybody ?
Wait !
Wait !
It 's Bilbo !
He 's alive !
Stop !
Stop !
Stop .
You need to leave .
We all need to leave .
We only just got here .
I 've tried talking , but he won 't listen .
- What do you mean , laddie ?
- Thorin !
Thorin .
Thorin .
He 's been down there for days .
He doesn 't sleep .
He barely eats .
He 's not been himself .
Not at all .
It 's this place .
Ahem . I think a sickness lies on it .
Sickness ?
What kind of sickness ?
Fili .
Fili !
Fili !
Gold .
Gold beyond measure .
Beyond sorrow ... and grief .
Behold ... the great ... treasure hoard of Thror .
Welcome ... my sister-sons ... to the Kingdom ... of Erebor .
Balin !
Kili !
Thank Durin , you 're alive .
Bombur !
You 're alive !
Any sign of it ?
Nothing yet .
Nothing here .
Keep searching !
That Jewel could be anywhere .
The Arkenstone is in these halls .
- Find it !
You heard him .
- Keep looking .
All of you !
No one rests until ... it is found .
I am almost tempted ... to let you take it .
If only ... to see Oakenshield ... suffer .
Watch it ... destroy him .
Watch it corrupt ... his heart ... and drive him mad .
I 've got you .
Take only what you need .
We have a long march ahead .
Where will you go ?
There is only one place .
The Mountain .
You are a genius , sire .
We can take refuge inside the Mountain .
It might smell a bit of dragon , but the women can clean that up .
It 'll be safe and warm and dry ... and full of stores ... bedding , clothing ... the odd bit of gold .
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed .
We will take only what was promised to us .
Only what we need to rebuild ... our lives .
Here .
Pull your weight .
News of the death of Smaug will have spread through the lands .
Aye .
Others will now look to the Mountain ... for its wealth ... for its position .
What is it you know ?
Nothing for certain .
It 's what I fear may come .
AZOG IN
BOLG IN
You saw something out there .
The Ore I pursued out of Lake-town , I know who he is .
Bolg , spawn at Azog the Defiler .
A Warg pack was waiting for him on the outskirts of Esgaroth .
They fled into the North .
These Ores were different from the others .
They bore a mark I have not seen for a long time .
The mark of Gundabad .
Gundabad ?
An Orc stronghold ... in the far North of the Misty Mountains .
FEREN
You may tell my father ... if there is no place for Tauriel , there is no place for me .
Legolas .
It is your king 's command .
I ride North .
Will you come with me ?
To where ?
To Gundabad .
Nine ... for mortal Men doomed to die .
I am not alone .
Are you in need of assistance , my lady ?
You should 've stayed ... dead .
Mithrandir ... come back .
He is here .
Yes .
The darkness has returned .
Gandalf !
Gandalf !
Climb on !
He is weak .
He cannot remain here .
It is draining his life .
Go !
Quickly !
Come with me , my lady .
Go !
You have no ... power here ... servant of Morgoth .
You ... are nameless .
Faceless .
Formless .
Go back to the void ... from whence you came !
The spirit of Sauron endured .
And has been banished .
He will flee into the East .
Gondor ... should be warned .
They must set a watch on the walls of Mordor .
No .
Look after the Lady Galadriel .
She has spent much of her power .
Her strength is failing .
Take her to Lothlérien .
My Lord Saruman .
He must be hunted down ... and destroyed once and for all .
Without the Ring of Power ... Sauron can never again hold dominion over Middle-earth .
Go now .
Leave Sauron to me .
I need a horse .
What ?
Gandalf ...
- where are you going ?
- To warn Erebor .
They have no idea what is coming .
I saw them ... with my own eyes , rank upon rank of Moria Orcs .
You must summon our friends , bird and beast .
The battle for the Mountain is about to begin .
It is here in these halls .
I know it .
We have searched and searched .
Not well enough .
Thorin , we all would see the stone returned .
And yet , it is still not found !
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here ?
The Arkenstone ... is the birthright of our people .
It is The Kings Jewel .
Am I not the king ?
Know this :
If anyone should find it ... and withhold it from me ...
I will be avenged .
Dragon-sickness .
I 've seen it before .
That look .
The terrible need .
It is a fierce and jealous love , Bilbo .
It sent his grandfather mad .
Balin , if Thorin ... had the Arkenstone ... or if ... it was found ... would it help ?
That stone crowns all .
It is the summit of this great wealth ... bestowing power ... upon he who bears it .
Would it stay his madness ?
No , laddie .
I fear it would make him worse .
Perhaps it is best ... it remains lost .
What is that ?
In your hand .
It 's nothing .
Show me .
It ...
I picked it up in Beorn 's garden .
You 've carried it all this way ?
I 'm gonna plant it in my garden .
In Bag End .
It 's a poor prize to take back to the Shire .
One day , it 'll grow .
And every time I look at it , I 'll remember .
Remember everything that happened , the good , the bad ... and how lucky I am that I made it home .
Thorin , I ...
Thorin .
Survivors from Lake-town ... they 're streaming into Dale .
There 's hundreds of them .
Call everyone to the gate .
To the gate !
Now !
Come on .
- Keep moving .
Sire !
Sire !
Up here !
Look , sire !
The braziers are lit .
So ... the Company of Thorin Oakenshield survived .
Survived ?
There 's a bunch of Dwarves with all that gold ?
I shouldn 't worry , Alfrid .
There 's gold enough in that Mountain for all .
Make camp here tonight !
Find what shelter you can .
Get some fires going .
Come on , hurry along now .
Alfrid .
You 'll take ... the night watch .
Up it goes !
That 's it .
I want this fortress made safe by sunup .
This Mountain was hard-won .
I will not see it taken again .
The people of Lake-town have nothing .
They came to us in need .
They have lost everything .
Do not tell me what they have lost .
I know well enough their hardship .
Those who have lived through dragon fire ... should rejoice .
They have much ... to be grateful for .
More stone .
Bring more stone to the gate !
That 's it .
These children are starving .
- MAN 2 : We need food .
We won 't last three days .
Bard ...
- we don 't have enough .
- Do what you can , Percy .
It 'll be all right .
Don 't worry .
We need more water .
The children , the wounded and the women come first .
Here you are .
Good morning , Alfrid .
What news from the night watch ?
All quiet , sire .
Not much to report .
Nothing gets past me .
Except an army of Elves , it would seem .
My Lord Thranduil , we did not look ...
- to see you here .
- I heard you needed aid .
Here you go .
Pass it back .
Another one .
You have saved us .
I do not know how to thank you .
Your gratitude is misplaced .
I did not come on your behalf .
I came to reclaim something of mine .
There are gems in the Mountain that I , mo , desire .
White gems of pure starlight .
The White Gems of Lasgalen .
I know an Elf Lord who will pay a pretty price for these .
Wait !
Please wait !
You would go to war over a handful of gems ?
The heirlooms of my people are not lightly forsaken .
We are allies in this .
My people ... also have a claim upon the riches in that Mountain .
Let me ... speak with Thorin .
You would try to reason with the Dwarf ?
To avoid war ?
Yes .
Not a bad night 's work .
Come on .
Hail , Thorin , son of Thrain .
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope .
Why do you come to the gates ... of the King under the Mountain armed for war ?
Why does the King under the Mountain fence himself in ... like a robber in his hold ?
Perhaps it is because I am expecting to be robbed .
My lord ... we have not come to rob you ... but to seek fair settlement .
Will you not speak with me ?
I am listening .
On behalf of the people of Lake-town ... I ask that you honor your pledge .
A share of the treasure ... so that they might rebuild their lives .
I will not treat with any man ... while an armed host lies before my door .
That armed host will attack this Mountain if we do not come to terms .
And your threats do not sway me .
What of your conscience ?
Does it not tell you our cause is just ?
My people offered you help .
And in return , you brought upon them only ruin and death .
When did Lake-town come to our aid but for the promise of rich reward ?
A bargain was struck !
A bargain ?
What choice did we have but to barter our birthright ... for blankets and food ?
To ransom ... our future in exchange for our freedom ?
You call that a fair trade ?
Tell me ...
Bard the Dragon-Slayer ... why should I honor such terms ?
Because you gave us your word .
Does that mean nothing ?
Be gone !
Ere our arrows ... fly !
What are you doing ?
You cannot go to war .
- This does not concern you .
- Excuse me ... but in case you haven 't noticed , there is an army of Elves out there .
Not to mention several hundred angry fishermen .
We are , in fact , outnumbered .
Not for much longer .
What does that mean ?
It means , Master Baggins ... you should never underestimate Dwarves .
We have reclaimed Erebor .
Now ... we defend it .
He will give us nothing .
Such a pity .
Still ...
- you tried .
- I do not understand .
Why ?
Why would he risk war ?
It is fruitless to reason with them .
They understand ... only one thing .
We attack at dawn .
Are you with us ?
Aye .
Master Baggins , come here .
You 're going to need this .
Put it on .
This vest is made of silver steel .
Mithril ... it was called by my forebears .
No blade can Pierce it .
I look absurd .
I 'm not a warrior , I 'm a Hobbit .
It is a gift .
A token of our friendship .
True friends are hard to come by .
I have been blind ... but now I begin to see .
I am betrayed .
Betrayed ?
The Arkenstone .
One of them has taken it .
One of them is false .
Thorin ... the Quest is fulfilled , you 've won the Mountain .
Is that not enough ?
- Betrayed by my own kin .
- Now , uh ... you made a promise to the people of Lake-town .
Now , is this treasure ... truly worth more than your honor ?
Our honor , Thorin .
I was also there .
I gave my word .
For that , I am grateful .
It was nobly done , but the treasure ... does not belong to the people ... of Lake-town .
This gold ... is ours .
And ours alone .
By my life ...
I will not part ... with a single coin .
Not ... one ... piece of it .
Gundabad .
What lies beyond ?
An old enemy .
The ancient kingdom ... of Angmar .
This fortress was once its stronghold .
It is where they kept their great armories .
Forged their weapons of war .
A light .
I saw movement .
We wait for the cover of night .
It is a fell place , Tauriel .
In another age , our people waged war ... on those lands .
My mother died there .
My father does not speak of it .
There is no grave .
No memory .
Nothing .
- Unh !
Let me through !
Make way !
No , no .
No !
Oi !
You !
Pointy hat !
Yes .
You . We don 't want no tramps , beggars ... nor vagabonds here .
We got enough trouble without the likes of you .
Off you go .
On your horse .
Who 's in charge here ?
Who is asking ?
You must set aside your petty grievances with the Dwarves .
War is coming !
The cesspits ... of Dol Guldur have been ... emptied .
You 're all ... in mortal danger .
What are you talking about ?
You know nothing ... of Wizards .
They are like winter thunder on a wild wind ... rolling in from a distance , breaking hard in alarm .
But sometimes a storm ... is just a storm .
Not this time .
Armies of Orcs are on the move .
These are fighters .
They have been bred for war .
Our enemy has summoned his full strength .
Why show his hand now ?
Because we forced him .
We forced him when the Company of Thorin set out to reclaim ... their homeland .
The Dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor .
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them .
His master seeks control of the Mountain .
Not just for the treasure within ... but for where it lies , its strategic position .
This is the gateway ... to reclaiming the lands of Angmar in the North .
If that fell kingdom should rise again ... Rivendell , Lorien , the Shire ... even Gondor itself , will fall .
These Orc armies you speak of , Mithrandir ... where are they ?
AZOG IN
TAURIEL
These bats are bred for one purpose .
For what ?
For war .
Since when has my counsel counted for so little ?
What do you think I 'm trying to do ?
Save your Dwarvish friends , and I admire ... your loyalty to them .
But it does not dissuade me from my course .
You started this , Mithrandir .
You will forgive me if I finish it .
Are the archers in position ?
Yes , my lord .
- Give the order .
If anything moves on that Mountain ... kill it .
The Dwarves are out of time .
You , Bowman !
Do You agree ?
Is gold so important to you ?
Would you buy it with the blood of Dwarves ?
It won 't come to that .
- This is a fight they cannot win .
That won 't stop them .
You think the Dwarves will surrender ?
They won 't .
They will fight to the death .
Bilbo Baggins .
If I 'm not mistaken ... this is the Halfling who stole the keys ... to my dungeons from under ... the nose of my guards .
Yes .
Sorry ... about that .
I came ... to give you ... this .
The Heart of the Mountain .
The King 's Jewel .
And worth a king 's ransom .
How is this ... yours to give ?
I took it as my 14th share of the treasure .
Why would you do this ?
You owe us no loyalty .
I 'm not doing it for you .
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate ... and pigheaded ... and difficult .
They 're suspicious and secretive ... with the worst manners ... imaginable , but they are also brave ... and kind ... and loyal to a fault .
I 've grown ... very fond of them , and I would save them if I can .
Now , Thorin ... values this stone above all else .
In exchange for its return , he will give you ... what you are owed .
There will be no need ... for war .
Rest up tonight .
- You must leave on the morrow .
- What ?
- Get as far away from here as possible .
- I 'm not leaving .
You picked me as the 14th man .
I 'm not leaving the Company .
There is no Company .
Not anymore .
Imagine what Thorin will do when he finds out what you 've done .
I 'm not afraid of Thorin .
Well , you should be .
Don 't underestimate ... the evil of gold .
Gold over which ... a serpent has long brooded .
Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts of all ... who come near this Mountain .
Almost all .
Heh .
You there .
Find this Hobbit a bed ... and fill his belly with hot food .
He 's earned it .
Hey .
Keep an eye on him .
If he should try ... to leave , you tell me .
Move it !
Stupid Hobbit .
Wakey-wakey , Hobbit .
Up you get .
I will put the next one between your eyes .
We have come to tell you ... payment of your debt has been offered ... and accepted .
What payment ?
I gave you nothing .
You have nothing .
We have this .
They have the Arkenstone .
Thieves !
How came you by the heirloom of our house ?
That stone belongs to the king !
And the king may have it ... with our goodwill .
But first he must honor his word .
They are taking us for fools .
This is a ruse .
A filthy lie .
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain !
It is a trick !
It 's no trick .
The stone is real .
I gave it to them .
You ?
I took it as my 14th share .
You would steal from me ?
Steal from you ?
No .
No , I may be a burglar , but I like to think I 'm an honest one .
I 'll let it stand against my claim .
Against your claim ?
Your claim .
You have no claim over me , you miserable rat !
I was going to give it to you .
- Many times I wanted to , but ...
- But what ... thief ?
You are changed , Thorin .
The Dwarf I met ... in Bag End would never have gone back on his word .
Would never have doubted ... the loyalty of his kin !
Do not speak to me ... of loyalty .
Throw him from the rampart !
Did you not hear me ?
I will do it myself . Curse you !
No !
Cursed be the Wizard ...
- that forced you on us !
- If you don 't like my burglar ... then please ... don 't damage him .
Return him to me .
You 're not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain ... are you , Thorin ... son of Thrain ?
Never again will I have dealings with Wizards !
Go .
Or Shire rats !
Are we resolved ?
The return ... of the Arkenstone for what was promised ?
Give us your answer .
Will you have peace ... or war ?
I will have war .
Ironfoot .
Who is that ?
He doesn 't look very happy .
It is Dain , Lord of the Iron Hills .
Thorin 's ...
- cousin .
- Are they alike ?
I 've always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two .
Good morning .
How are we all ?
I have a wee proposition ... if you wouldn 't mind giving me a few moments ... of your time .
Would you consider ... just sodding off ?
All of you !
Right now !
Stand fast .
Come now , Lord Dain .
Gandalf the Grey .
Tell this rabble ... to leave , or I 'll water ... the ground with their blood !
No need for war ... between Dwarves , Men and Elves .
A legion of Orcs ... march on the Mountain .
Stand down .
I will not stand down before any Elf .
Not least this faithless Woodland sprite .
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people .
If he chooses ... to stand between me and my kin ...
I 'll split his pretty head open !
See if he 's still smirking then .
He 's clearly mad , like his cousin .
You hear that , lads ?
We 're on !
Let 's give these bastards a good hammering !
Were-worms .
Oh , come on .
The hordes of hell are upon us !
To battle !
To battle , sons of Durin !
I 'm going over the wall .
Who 's coming with me ?
Aye !
Come on , let 's go !
Stand down .
What ?
Are we to do nothing ?
I said , stand down !
The Elves .
Will they not fight ?
Thranduil !
This is madness !
Charge !
Yes !
Uh , Gandalf ?
Is this a good place to stand ?
Azog .
He 's trying to cut us off .
All of you !
Fall back to Dale !
Now !
To the city !
Bilbo !
This way !
Sigrid !
Tilda !
My children !
Where are my children ?
I saw them !
They were down in the old market !
The market ?
Where are they now ?
Tilda !
Sigrid !
Bard !
Orcs are storming over the causeway !
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet .
Hold them off as long as you can .
Archers !
This way !
The Orcs have taken Stone Street !
The market 's overrun !
The rest of you ... follow me !
Charge !
Onward !
To the death !
Da !
Da !
Here !
We 're down here !
Bain !
Sigrid !
Get down !
Listen !
Gather the women and children .
Take them to the Great Hall ... and barricade the door .
You understand ?
You must not come out for any reason .
We want to stay with you !
Show your father some respect .
You leave it to me ... sire .
You heard him .
- We make for the Great Hall .
- Alfrid !
Women and children only .
I need every man ... fighting .
See that you return .
I 'll get them to safety , sire .
Then my sword is yours to command .
Get up !
Look after them .
Shift it , granny !
Make for the Great Hall !
Out of my way !
Abandon the cripples !
You buggers !
Where 's Thorin ?
We need him !
Where is he ?
Fall back !
Since when do we forsake ... our own people ?
Thorin ... they are dying ... out there .
There are halls beneath halls within this Mountain .
Places we can fortify ... shore up , make safe .
Yes . that is it .
We must move the gold further underground ...
- to safety .
- Did you hear me ?
Dain is surrounded .
They 're being slaughtered , Thorin .
Many die in war .
Life is cheap .
But a treasure ... such as this cannot be counted ... in lives lost .
It is worth ... all the blood we can spend .
You sit here in these vast halls ... with a crown upon your head ... and yet you are lesser now than you have ever been .
Do not speak to me ... as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord ... as if ...
Thorin ...
Oakenshield .
- I am your king !
- You were always my king .
You used to know that once .
You cannot see what you have become .
Go .
Get out .
Before I kill you .
You sit here ... with a crown upon your head .
You are lesser now than you have ever been .
But a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost .
A sickness lies upon that treasure .
The blind ambition of a Mountain King .
Am I not the king ?
This gold ... is ours .
And ours alone .
I will not part ... with a single coin .
He could not see beyond his own desire !
As if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord ...
Thorin Oakenshield .
A sickness which drove your grandfather mad .
This is Thorin ... son of Thrain , son of Thror !
I am not my grandfather .
I am not my grandfather .
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin .
They are dying out there .
Take back Erebor .
Dain is surrounded .
Dying .
Is surrounded .
Dying .
Take back your homeland .
You are changed , Thorin .
I am not my grandfather .
Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor ?
I am not my grandfather .
This treasure wilt be your death !
Fall back !
Fall back ... to the Mountain !
Fall back !
AZOG IN
I will not hide ... behind a wall of stone ... while others fight our battles for us !
It is not in my blood , Thorin .
No .
It is not .
We are sons of Durin .
And Durin 's Folk ... do not flee from a fight .
I have no right to ask this of any of you .
But will you follow me ... one last time ?
Thorin .
To the king !
To the king !
The Dwarves .
They 're rallying .
They 're rallying to their king .
Any man who wants to give their last ... follow me !
I say we stand with our men in life and in death .
- I 'm with you .
Arm yourselves .
- Come with us .
No , no , no .
- You leave an old woman be .
- Don 't be afraid .
I said , get off !
Alfrid Lickspittle .
You are a coward .
Coward ?
Not every man 's brave enough to wear a corset .
You 're not a man .
You 're a weasel .
Dain !
Thorin !
Hold on !
I 'm coming !
Hey , cousin !
What took you so long ?
There 's too many of these buggers , Thorin .
I hope you 've got a plan .
Aye .
We 're going to take out their leader .
Azog ?
I 'm gonna kill that piece of filth .
Lead on !
We may yet survive this .
Gandalf !
It 's Thorin .
And Fili , Kili ... and Dwalin .
He 's taking his best warriors .
To do what ?
To cut the head off the snake .
Die !
Gandalf !
Legolas .
Legolas Greenleaf .
There is a second army .
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs .
They are almost upon us .
Gundabad .
This was their plan all along .
Azog engages our forces , then Bolg sweeps in from the North .
The North ?
Where is the North ...
- exactly ?
- Ravenhill .
Ravenhill ?
Thorin is up there .
And Fili and Kili .
They 're all up there .
Where is he ?
It looks empty .
I think Azog has fled .
I don 't think so .
Fili ... take your brother .
Scout out the towers .
Keep low and out of sight .
If you see something ... report back .
Do not engage .
- Do you understand ?
- We have company .
Goblin mercenaries .
No more than a hundred .
We 'll take care of them .
Go !
Go !
Come on !
Recall your company .
My lord , dispatch this force ... to Ravenhill .
The Dwarves are about ... to be overrun .
Thorin must be warned .
By all means , warn him .
I have spent enough Elvish blood in defense ... of this accursed land .
Thranduil ?
I 'll go .
Don 't be ridiculous .
You 'll never make it .
Why not ?
Because they will see you coming and kill you .
No , they won 't .
They won 't see me .
It 's out of the question .
I won 't allow it .
I 'm not asking you to allow it , Gandalf .
TAURIEL
You will not turn away .
Not this time .
Get out of my way .
The Dwarves will be slaughtered .
Yes , they will die .
Today ... tomorrow ... one year hence , a hundred years from now .
What does it matter ?
They are mortal .
You think your life is worth more ... when there is no love in it ?
There is no love in you .
What do you know of love ?
Nothing .
What you feel for that Dwarf ... is not real .
You think it is love ?
Are you ready to die for it ?
LEGOLAS
I will go with you .
Get up .
Get away from me .
I don 't take orders ... from you .
People trusted you .
They listened to you .
The Master 's mantle ... was there for the taking ... and you threw it all away .
For what ?
Alfrid ... your slip is showing .
Hey .
Stay here .
Search the lower levels .
I 've got this .
Where is that Orc filth ?
Thorin .
Bilbo .
You have to leave here .
Now .
Azog has an army attacking from the North .
This watchtower will be surrounded .
- With no way out .
- We are so close .
That Orc scum is in there .
I say we push on .
No .
That 's what he wants .
He wants to draw us in .
This is a trap .
Ah .
Find Fili and Kili .
Call them back .
Thorin , are you sure about this ?
Do it .
We 'll live to fight another day .
Oh ...
AZOG IN
Go .
Run !
Kili !
Thorin .
Thorin .
No .
No .
Kili .
Kili !
Kili !
Tauriel !
Kili .
No !
No !
Mm .
Tauriel !
The Eagles are coming .
Bilbo .
Don 't move .
Don 't move .
Lie still .
Oh .
Mm .
Mm .
I 'm glad you are here .
- Shh , shh .
- Unh .
I wish to part from you in friendship .
No .
You are not going anywhere .
You 're going to live .
I would take back ... my words and my deeds at the Gate .
You did what only a true friend would do .
Forgive me .
I was too blind to see it .
I am so sorry ... that I have led you into such peril .
No , I 'm glad to have shared in your perils , Thorin .
Each and every one of them .
It is far more than any Baggins deserves .
Farewell ...
Master Burglar .
Go back to your books .
And your armchair .
Plant your trees .
Watch them grow .
If more people ... valued home ... above gold ... this world would be a merrier place .
No .
No , no , no .
No .
Thorin .
Thorin , don 't you dare .
Thorin .
Thorin .
Thorin , hold on .
Hold on , please .
The Eagles ...
The Eagles ...
The Eagles are here .
Thorin ?
The Ea ...
I cannot go back .
Where will you go ?
I do not know .
Go north .
Find the Dunedain .
There 's a young Ranger amongst them .
You should meet him .
His father , Arathorn , was a good man .
His son ... might grow to be a great one .
What is his name ?
He 's known in the Wild as Strider .
His true name ... you must discover for yourself .
Legolas .
Your mother loved you .
More than anyone .
More than life .
They want to bury him .
Yes .
If this is love , I do not want it .
Take it from me .
Please .
Why does it hurt so much ?
Because it was real .
There is to be a great feast tonight .
Songs will be sung . Tales will be told .
And Thorin Oakenshield ... will pass into legend .
I know that 's how you must honor him .
But to me , he was never that .
He was ...
To me ... he was ...
I 'll slip quietly away .
Will you tell the others I said goodbye ?
You can tell them yourself .
If any of you are ever passing Bag End , uh ... tea is at 4 .
There 's plenty of it .
You are welcome anytime .
Uh ...
Don 't bother knocking .
Ah , the borders of the Shire .
It is here I must leave you .
That 's a shame .
I quite liked having ... a Wizard around .
Seems they bring good luck .
You don 't really suppose , do you , that all your adventures and escapes ... were managed by mere luck ?
Magic rings should not be used lightly , Bilbo .
Don 't take me for a fool .
I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels .
And I 've kept my eye on you ... ever since .
Well , thank goodness .
Farewell , Gandalf .
Farewell .
You , uh ... You needn 't worry about that ring .
Fell out of my pocket during the battle .
I lost it .
You 're a very fine person , Mr. Baggins .
And I 'm very fond ... of you .
But you 're only quite a little fellow ... in a wide world after all .
Wait a minute , that 's my mother 's glory box .
And that 's my dining chair .
Ah ...
Put that pouf down !
What is going on ?
Hello ...
Mr. Bilbo .
You 're not supposed to be here .
What do you mean ?
On account of you being presumed dead .
I am not dead .
Presumed or otherwise .
I 'm not sure that 's permitted .
Mr. Bilbo !
Any advance on 21 ?
Any advance on 21 ?
Ha , ha !
Sold to Mrs. Bolger .
Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on .
Any bids for this ?
This is Shire-made .
No Dwarvish reproductions here .
Stop !
Stop !
- There 's been a mistake !
Who are you ?
Who am I ?
You know who I am ...
Lobelia Sackville-Baggins .
This is my home .
And those are my spoons .
Thank you very much .
This is most irregular .
- Excuse me .
It 's been more ... than 13 months since the disappearance .
If you are in fact ...
Bilbo Baggins and undeceased ... can you prove it ?
What ?
Something official with your name ... on it would suffice .
All right .
Right .
A contract of employment as a bur ...
Never mind as what .
There .
My signature .
Yes , well ... Uh ...
Well , it certainly seems to be in order .
Yes .
Seems there can be no doubt .
Who is this you pledged your service to ?
Thorin Oakenshield ?
He ...
He was my friend .
No , thank you !
We don 't want any more visitors , well-wishers ... or distant relations !
And what about ... very old friends ?
Gandalf ?
Bilbo Baggins .
My dear Gandalf !
Ha , ha !
It 's good to see you .
One hundred and 11 years old .
Who would believe it ?
Come on , come in !
Welcome .
Welcome .
